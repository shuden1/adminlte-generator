One of our co-founders, Andrew Garcia, had a DJ business in college, and found that renting out equipment could be difficult and tedious. With his many years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, he knew he could change that. He partnered with Erik Dreyer, our other co-founder and UX extraordinaire, to build technology that made rentals easy.

Their first rental marketplace was targeted at peer-to-peer rentals, but after receiving so much demand for event rentals, they transitioned to gear their rental solutions to the industry from which Andrew originally came: events.

After interviewing a diverse array of event professionals, the pair realized they first must build a comprehensive software system in order to maximize the rental experience for both the vendors and the renters. They wanted to design a software program that not only did what event professionals needed it to do, but made it easy, fast and delightful along the way.

With renewed focus, the duo hit the ground running. They hired our Executive Vice President, Karen Gordon, who had years of experience growing companies in both the events and technology sectors. The trio launched their SaaS platform, Goodshuffle Pro, in 2017 as a beta program and officially premiered the software at a trade show in January 2018.

By 2019 the software was in 45 US states, Canada and Mexico. The company was crowned “Best Tech Startup in DC” and one of the “Coolest Places to Work” in 2020. Since then, our team, user base, and product have grown exponentially— and this is just the beginning.
