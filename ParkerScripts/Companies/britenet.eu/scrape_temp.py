The analysis did not yield any selectors matching the criteria for job listings, which suggests that the specific elements I searched for based on generic patterns were not present or the class names used did not match the patterns I anticipated. Given this outcome, the next step—in alignment with the original request—would be to attempt to proceed to STEP 2 with the understanding that the required selectors will vary based on the actual structure of the HTML content, which was not accurately identified in this preliminary analysis.

Without the correct selectors from STEP 1, I'm unable to proceed to STEP 2 as per the instructions provided. Normally, this process would involve manually reviewing the HTML content to accurately identify the correct selectors. If there are more specific details or a different approach you'd like to try, please let me know.
