Without direct access to the file's content to revise the selectors accurately, generating another version of the script based on the previous mistake without additional input would likely yield the same result. 

Given the outcome and limitations, I recommend reviewing the HTML file structure to identify the correct selectors for job titles and URLs. Ensure the selectors match the actual content structure of the provided HTML file. If possible, provide specific details about the structure around job titles and URLs for a more accurate script adaptation.
