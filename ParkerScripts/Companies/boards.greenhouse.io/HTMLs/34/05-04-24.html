<p><strong>About Zwift:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zwift is the fitness company born from gaming, and we’re on a mission to make </span><strong>more people, more active, more often</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Zwift platform delivers an at-home training game that connects cyclists and runners in over 200 countries across the globe! Launched from the sunny shores of Long Beach, California in 2014, we’ve grown to have a distributed workforce across the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Some reasons we think you will love it here:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Zwift, we want to inspire each other, build on each other’s ideas, and celebrate the wins together. We all play a role in the success of Zwift, and it takes Watopians (that’s what we call our employees!) across the globe to make it all happen. Love cycling? Awesome. Haven’t ridden a bike since you were 8? Cool. Never learned how to ride a bike? We’ve got the best teachers if you want to learn. If not, no sweat. We celebrate the value of different perspectives. That’s how we grow and become an inclusive game, company, and community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a passionate, energized, and innovative team. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like bikes. We like running. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We admire a healthy work/life balance too - offering “Wednesday Wellness” to all Watopians to prioritize wellness for your body and mind.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our Values</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Values are at the core of what we do, and we aspire to bring them to life in the ways we work, play, and connect. Our Company Values are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zwift For Everyone</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We aspire for Zwift to be a safe and welcoming place for everyone. We seek to understand different perspectives, demonstrate empathy, and value diverse skill sets.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Progress</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pursue opportunity and take calculated risks. We align on outcomes, iterate to improve, and tolerate imperfection in favor of progress.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Always Level Up</strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We constantly look for growth by developing our skills, capabilities, and execution. We remain curious, learn quickly, and embrace change.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Future of Work at Zwift</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have thought long and hard about the Future of Work and what that will mean for our Watopians. COVID-19 provided us the opportunity to look outside of our normal markets for talent, and that is something that we will continue to do as we embrace this next chapter of work. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to welcome people to our teams from all over the world, and we're thrilled with the diversity of perspectives that brings.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zwift is excited to offer a default 2+3 hybrid working model (two days in office and three days at home each week) for those that are near one of our offices. We consider each role individually to determine what the role, work, and team require – if there’s a specific need for you to be in the office more than the standard 2+3, it’ll be included in the job posting. We want to hire the best people, regardless of location – if you aren’t close to an office, we encourage you to still apply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We care about you as our candidate, so let your Talent Acquisition Partner know if there’s anything we can do to support a smooth interview process. We are always looking for ways to level up our candidate experience – </span><strong>Always Level Up</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in action right there!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these Values and Future of Work principles align with your own behaviors and thoughts, check out our current opportunities and come join the mission to make more people, more active, more often.</span></p>
