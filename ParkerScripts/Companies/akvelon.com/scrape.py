Given that the uploaded file is not accessible with the `myfiles_browser` tool, I cannot proceed with analyzing its content to identify the required HTML selectors as instructed in STEP 1. However, if you're able to provide the HTML content in text format or any other way that is accessible within this environment, I would be able to assist further. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
