numbers come alive with storytelling","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-as-a-business-controller"},"intro":"How do you tell the story behind the numbers? Kiki Ruedisueli spoke enthusiastically about her work and the role that robots and storytelling play in it.","content":"“What does a Business Controller Operations do? We act as sparring partners and trusted advisers for the departments we are responsible for—in my case, that is Operations. As Business Controller, I report to the management team on figures and budgets. I like to say that we are “the financial conscience.” This means that in the work we do and the advice we give, we are always mindful of the fact that it must contribute to the ambition of being a healthy bank. In addition, I find it important that the insights I share fit within the scope, strategy, and ambitions of Rabobank without losing sight of the people behind it.”\n\nFrom junior to management team\n\n“I started at Rabobank in a temp role and was then hired as a Business Controller. I've been doing that for about three and a half years now, but I've had so many opportunities and developed so much that it feels like I've had several jobs. In this role, it's important to understand how the organization works, what we do for our customers, and how we can strengthen each other within Rabobank. I see Operations as the “purring engine” of Rabobank. The department employs around 4,000 people who work directly for the benefit of our customers every day. What we do here matters to the outside world. The figures we calculate have an impact on society.”\n\n“From a junior position focused on general processes and reporting, I progressed to coordinating work such as the multi-year budget (midterm planning) and then became a trusted advisor to the management team. Every month, I present figures and insights to the management team, which bases its decisions on them. We discuss Rabobank’s budgets, future budgets, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Based on the figures, I explain the actions we can take. What I like is how Operations sees their Business Controllers as full MT members. You slot into the management team’s routine, joining them for everything from regular meetings to annual plans.”\n\n\n\nRobots enable storytelling\n\nWithin Operations, Kiki works for the Payments Department and, since recently, the Robotics Wealth Building and Insurance Department (RVV). Kiki: “They are not robots like in the movies, but solutions for automating processes, ranging from automatically sorting activities by priority to the automatic preparation of files. It is so wonderful to see how much value this creates across the bank. The other day, my fellow Business Controllers and I were brainstorming about the potential of robots in our profession. Which processes can we outsource? How can we get insights quickly? A lot of time goes into producing reports even though it would be more valuable to spend that time analyzing and advising.”\n\n“The way you explain figures is so important. I focus on the story behind the figures, that's where my role adds value: storytelling. It’s a skill that is becoming increasingly important, alongside skills such as complex problem-solving and analytical skills. Storytelling brings to life the story behind a hard number. As Business Controllers, we move from numbers to consultancy. We also call this a move from Chief Finance Officer to Chief Value Officer. This is why I think storytelling is an incredibly important skill to keep developing.”\n\nPersonal development\n\nRabobank offers all kinds of opportunities for personal and professional development. As an employee, you can arrange your own development path and your career, for example with the personal development budget. Kiki: “My manager and I look at which areas I want to develop further in. What appeals to me, what do I still want to learn, where can I contribute? I am very eager to learn and enjoy acquiring new knowledge. For instance, I attend seminars on leadership or knowledge sessions. But I also like talking to people on the floor about how they do their work. Another option is to temporarily join another department. I got to work at Investor Relations for six months on the publication of the annual figures. That was incredibly valuable for my development. The culture is open, everyone is always willing to brainstorm with you or explain something.”\n\nRecovery time does not appear to be a word in Kiki's dictionary. “That’s true! But, because we work hybrid at Rabobank, I have the freedom to have a flexible schedule. After an intensive session, I love to go for a long walk in the woods with my dogs just to clear my head and let everything sink in. When I get back, I return to work fresh. I am 110% committed to our customers and my colleagues. I believe that by doing your job well, by really going that extra mile, you make the world a better place.”\n\nWhen asked where she will be in five years, Kiki replied, “I find that an incredibly difficult question. I have broad interests and the opportunities within the bank are endless, so I'm sure the next one will present itself. And in the words of Pippi Longstocking, “I've never tried that before, so I think I definitely should be able to do that.” Perhaps I’ll go see what’s happening around IT or make a parallel step to another position. As far as I'm concerned, growth can be both horizontal and vertical. My path is not yet finished at Rabobank, I am 100% sure of that.”","createdAt":1701878319,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"d52b8037e46c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Making numbers come alive with storytelling","image":{"_key":"8a47fe4e2552","_type":"image","alt":"Woman in blue suit (Business Controller) standing at glass wall.","asset":{"_ref":"image-ba40b400df8918a092d47e2b68dd185867750319-1613x1075-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-acumen","business-process-improvements","business-reporting","change-agility","customer-focused","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","storytelling","data-insights","risk-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"finance-risk","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"7f3c729d-abec-437c-9182-d9dd5601d3ee","title":"Working at a data-driven and innovative bank","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-at-a-data-driven-and-innovative-bank-joost-kimmel"},"intro":"There are several reasons why it’s interesting for a BI Developer to work at Rabobank.

That’s where I discovered the importance of augmenting sustainability. I then wrote my master’s thesis about economic history and found I had an interest in finance. That all came together perfectly at Rabobank.”","content":"On this traineeship, you do multiple rotations over the course of a year and a half and get to know the bank and yourself. Joris explained, “I found a lot of very specific traineeships when I first started looking around. My education was more broad and I didn’t know exactly what I wanted. That is why this traineeship at Rabobank was an excellent opportunity for me to find out what was a good fit for me.”\n\nThe First Week\n\n“What I remember about my first weeks is that there were a lot of presentations and lots of trainees and local bank employees to meet. In the early months there are a lot of training sessions aimed at expanding your financial knowledge, as well as soft skills development in Raboschools. I really liked one training in particular: the “Banking Simulation Game,” where you get to play bank director for a week and learn exactly how a bank works.”\n\nAfter that, it’s time to get down to brass tacks. Joris recalled, “I started in the Day-to-Day Banking Affairs department, where you come into contact with private customers. Then I got to keep moving around to different departments of the bank. First over to financial advice, where I learned to advise our customers about their finances. Then I moved on to SME advisory, where I got to help work out business plans. Eventually I moved to a rotation with the Cooperative Directors in Amsterdam to see how the different departments can implement the cooperative themes.”\n\nCooperatieve Themes\n\n“It’s fascinating to realize how the bank is very much at the center of society,” Joris said, as he described Rabobank’s five cooperative themes: Sustainable Living, Sustainable Entrepreneurship, the Energy Transition, Leading a Financially Healthy Life, and Banking4Food. One of his assignments is linked to these. “I worked on two features in the RaboApp: Energy Insights and Carbon Insights. The former shows customers how much energy they use and the latter shows the CO2 emissions related to their transactions. Focusing on the app was a conscious decision, because through it you automatically reach a lot of people.\"\n\n\n\nOutside Your Comfort Zone\n\nAccording to Joris, doing rotations within the bank is a great way to learn. “Because you start a new rotation every four months, you’re always starting from scratch. Of course, you build on what you’ve already learned, but the positions and departments are new. On every new rotation I always chose a completely different position than I’d had before. That’s how you learn the most.”\n\nLuckily, there is a lot of personal coaching, Joris explained, “There’s a Talent Manager, a mentor, and a buddy. Every trainee also gets assigned to a ‘circle coaching group,’ a group of Young Professionals from various parts of the bank. In this group, you talk to each other about your strengths and weaknesses. In the context of personal development, we also took a trip to Schiermonnikoog (a small island off of the Netherlands). Nobody told us what to expect, but while we were out there, we really got to know one another.”\n\nOwn Initiative\n\nShowing yourself is important as a trainee, said Joris. “You can get lucky, but things just don’t fall into your lap. Even with all the coaching, it is still important to plan your own appointments, get to know a lot of people, and talk about where you want to end up. Thankfully, everyone at Rabobank is very kind and eager to help you figure things out.”\n\n\n\nThe Next Step\n\nJoris has almost finished his traineeship and is enthusiastic about the special opportunity he’s been offered. “My final rotation is bringing me abroad. I’ll be spending the month in Singapore! I get to work with Value Chain Finance, a department that is primarily focused on working capital solutions for large corporations. I’m also getting proper supervision for this too; this morning I received intercultural training to help me prepare for meeting clients in different countries.”\n\nReflecting on his time backpacking through Asia, Joris recalled, “After I graduated from college, I still did not know exactly what I wanted to do, so I went traveling through Asia. Singapore was on my wish list then, but I ended up not going there. I am excited that I get to travel there now, but this time as a trainee.” When asked about his plans after he finishes the traineeship, Joris had a simple answer: “I’ve applied for several different jobs at Rabobank!”","createdAt":1700651575,"updatedAt":1716553217,"representation":{"_key":"0ced2452d509","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Discover all sides of the bank through the Cooperative Traineeship","image":{"_key":"c654b240e476","_type":"image","alt":"Young professional smiles in front of a Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-6bf60554a5b58d10931094cdb7aa9739fedf26e0-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["account-management","change-agility","consulting","creativity","customer-experience-cx","customer-focused","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","risk-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":null,"vakgebied":"student-starter","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"4771231c-efa7-443f-88cd-e5740e5ae370","title":"Protecting entrepreneurs from new forms of fraud","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"protecting-entrepreneurs-from-new-forms-of-fraud"},"intro":"Being curious, figuring things out, and getting to the bottom of things. According to Teamlead (FEC TM) Manual Signals Daniëlle, those are the most important traits for getting started in Financial Economic Crime (FEC). But you don’t have to be a sleuth. \"We want to discover how to prevent financial crime.\"","content":"“When I was doing my master’s degree in International Studies, I focused on Latin America and the theme of Global Security. I researched topics such as world politics, economics, and corruption. I knew then that I wanted to do something related to fighting financial crime after I graduated. Just not yet where, or what exactly. That's why I went traveling after completing my degree, while keeping an eye on LinkedIn, where I saw a position at Rabobank.\n\nStarting in a new field\n\nDanielle started out as an FEC analyst in the Transaction Monitoring (TM) department. \"In 2019, I joined a team of enthusiastic, inquisitive people. Most, like me, were fresh out of school. Only a few colleagues had previously worked in the justice system, policing, or criminal investigation. Little was known about FEC (which had only just been established) at that time within the organization and things were progressing rapidly. Fortunately, there was plenty of room and attention for development. In addition to customer research, we worked on knowledge transfer and policy direction.\"\n\n\nTools to grow\n\nThe field grew explosively, so initially the department was focused on handling cases. Once the department was set up, the focus shifted to people. Within FEC, that led to smaller teams with more personal attention. So within three years, Daniëlle became a team leader and was helping 15 team members grow in the profession.\n\n\"The opportunity presented itself and I seized it,\" Danielle says in a surprisingly calm tone. \"Yes, I hear that more often,\" she laughed. \"I'm very calm, unlike the pressure cooker of my career.\" Of course, I also had my doubts. Can I do this, is this moving too fast? Fortunately, Rabobank believed in me and gave me all the necessary tools to grow.\"\n\nPreventing fraud\n\nAs an FEC analyst, you check transactions and investigate where the money is coming from. In Transaction Monitoring, you can specialize in two areas. Team Alerts focuses on reports coming from Rabobank's internal transaction monitoring system. Team Signals conducts investigations based on external signals. \"Both teams look at transactions, just from a slightly different angle. I work in Team Signals. We deal with external reports: a newspaper article, a call from CDD (Customer Due Diligence) or a tip from an entrepreneur or collaboration partner about possible fraud.\"\n\n\nAs an example, Danielle describes what is known as tap fraud or contactless payment fraud. \"Tap fraud is when store employees pretend that a customer has returned something, but put their own debit card on the device for the refund. It often occurs at businesses that sell shoes or clothing, because returns are fairly common there. The company that supplied the payment machines discovered a pattern. They—like us—are required by law to check the transactions made with their devices. What amounts are involved, is it a return, can we detect an abnormal pattern? They transfer the data to us and we investigate what exactly is happening. If we think something is really not right, we inform the business.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we help entrepreneurs who face this kind of risk think about how we can prevent this from happening. Can we set conditions that limit this kind of fraud? Today, you have a limit on the maximum amount you can top up at a store or gas station. Yes, we can act quickly to stop a questionable transaction, but ideally we want to prevent tap fraud. That's what our gatekeeper role is all about.\"\n\nLearning about the world and working on yourself\n\nNew analysts on Team Signals first undergo five months of training at the Transaction Monitoring Campus. There, in addition to doing customer research, it's all about personal development. Where would you like to end up and what opportunities are there?\n\n\n\"The most important skills you need are logical reasoning and flexibility. The work environment is changing rapidly. When a country suddenly ends up on the sanctions list, it has an immediate impact on your work and you have to be able to switch gears quickly. In addition, you should enjoy figuring things out most of all. Being curious. You learn about business: corporate structures, taxes, imports, and exports. And we don't separate cases into private or corporate, so you deal with all kinds of files and cases. One day it’s crypto, another day it's foreign risks. You learn an awful lot about the world.\"\n\n\n\n\"As team lead, besides operations, I also do some HR work. I conduct job interviews with new analysts, do salary negotiations, and supervise reintegration processes. I completed a variety of courses to learn about everything from coaching to drawing up a plan for the UWV (Employee Insurance Agency). I am also working on my personal development through the coaching program for team leads: the focus there is on my own talents, qualities, and challenges.\"\n\n\"What do I want to do next? I don't know yet. You can go in any direction within Rabobank, like management or another department. As team leader you can basically work for any team. But for the time being, I will remain team leader at FEC. In addition to keeping up with cases and files, I answer questions and brainstorm about the future of this departmentwith the management team. The role is extremely versatile, which suits me fine.\"\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1707906015,"updatedAt":1708001748,"representation":{"_key":"2095a6092784","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Danielle","asset":{"_ref":"image-a3ee2155e05915808264ca28d95886c2692c047a-3074x5464-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"Protecting entrepreneurs from new forms of fraud"},"skills":["business-process-improvements","change-agility","coaching","critical-thinking","decision-making","problem-solving"],"proofPoints":["leadership","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"vakgebied","id":"05d7ecfe-55bd-4db8-9084-7e69ece382a4","title":"HR","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"hr"},"intro":"Our 40,000+ employees are the driving force behind Rabobank.

DevOps Engineer Ankit Bhimjiyani’s personal connection to the issue is what drives him to make a tangible difference. He explains how raising awareness, green coding, and demand shifting help developers and engineers implement sustainability in their work.","content":"Ankit’s journey into sustainable IT is driven by his concern for the future. “I was born in India, and it’s hard to see my country suffering from the effects of climate change. My parents still live in Mumbai, a city that’s facing more and more extreme weather. That’s the main reason I’m participating in this initiative.”\n\nEducating teams on sustainable IT practices\n\nWavemakers consists of a core team that’s supported by a virtual network of contributors. This includes engineers from various departments who collaborate on developing different tools. Ankit: “I heard about Wavemakers though my manager and decided to find out how I could help. As a DevOps engineer, I normally work on CRM processes at Rabobank, but now I get to spend a few hours every week working on Wavemakers. We aim to raise awareness by training and inspiring teams to adopt sustainable IT practices in their daily work. I help other IT teams understand the impact of the functionalities they are developing.”\n\n“For instance, we've developed the Carbon Insights Tool, a sustainability awareness tool that can measure the CO2 emissions from software features or IT processes. Looking at CRM, for example, we can calculate the CO2 emissions for scheduling an appointment in terms of resources used — memory, infrastructure, and actual laptop usage. The data reveals the energy impact and shows where we can improve. It's all about making our IT operations as green as possible.”\n\nReducing energy use by green coding\n\nAnother interesting way to reduce IT’s carbon footprint is by green coding. This is a relatively new IT practice that focuses on minimizing energy consumption and reducing carbon emissions from writing and running code.\n\n“We're working to reduce our technical debt. It’s a simple, yet very effective practice. We go back to old code, where we optimize logic and remove unnecessary queries. For example, if you're querying a database, make sure you only fetch the data you need. Often, you don’t need to query the complete CRM database to book an appointment for a customer. A subset will suffice and uses a lot less energy. Green coding makes the codebase lean and more efficient. As a nice bonus, the efficiency boost helps to convince stakeholders of the benefits of sustainable IT.”\n\n“Green coding really makes a difference. By adopting green coding practices, we're not only improving our systems, but also contributing to a more sustainable future. Every little change adds up, and as developers and engineers, we have a unique opportunity to make a significant impact.”\n\nOptimizing energy usage with strategic timing\n\n“A third way to save energy is by demand shifting. This means we carefully plan when we run our DevOps jobs. By running energy-intensive tasks during periods of low-energy demand, we can make better use of green energy. Therefore, we schedule non-critical updates during the night or on the weekend when energy usage is lower. And we turn off our test servers when we don’t use them.”\n\nAnkit's desire to make a difference has grown over the years, and Wavemakers has further intensified this passion. Sustainability matters to him not only at work, but also at home. “I've grown increasingly aware of all the small adjustments I could make to use less energy. At home, we now only run on the dishwasher and washing machine in the middle of the night. Or when the sun is shining brightly because we have solar panels.”\n\nChallenges for the future\n\nImplementing sustainable IT practices isn't without its challenges. From data collection to convincing stakeholders, the journey is complex, but Ankit's insights are both practical and inspiring.\n\n“We encourage everyone to join us in this important mission. It doesn’t matter if you're a developer, a business leader, or work in any other role; when you care about our planet, your actions can make a difference. Start small, and together we can create a more sustainable future.”\n\nWavemakers is not only about sustainable IT; it's also about making a lasting impact. As Ankit puts it: “The footprint of IT is expected to grow from its current almost 4% to 15% of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2040. But through our collective efforts, we can turn the tide towards a greener, more sustainable future. Initiatives like Wavemakers make me cautiously optimistic.”\n\nSources\n\nMillikin, M.

To redevelop the model for the international wholesale portfolio as a credit risk modeller is as complex as it is valuable. Senior Credit Risk Modeller Martin van Buren prefers to bite down on the most complicated quantitative issues and likes to talk about it.","content":"Risk analysis: a responsible task\n\n‘Risk is inherent in banking, because any loan has a chance of not being fully paid back. From mortgages to large corporate loans, for every loan portfolio in the bank there is a credit model that helps us manage the risks . Our team is working on the redevelopment of the PD-model of the international wholesale portfolio. To this end, we perform quantitative analyses on immense amounts of data to map out the creditworthiness of customers.’\n\n‘Our credit models are the basis for decision-making. That is quite a responsibility, especially when it comes to the international wholesale portfolio. Our clients range from Dutch SMEs to the listed corporates we all recognize from the economics section of the newspaper. In terms of credit risk capital, this is Rabobank’s largest portfolio.’\n\n‘So in terms of exposure, it’s billions – but the social impact is also huge. Many companies depend on our model. As one of the largest financial institutions in the Netherlands, Rabobank bears joint responsibility for a healthy financial climate. That pressure is palpable, both from the business and the ECB, but it is definitely motivating. We know very well what we are contributing to.’\n\nThe redevelopment of redevelopments\n\n‘Modelling is always a cyclical process, but the cycle we are now in is of unprecedented proportions. I have been working for Rabobank since 2007 and have never done a project as extensive as the redevelopment of this model. The data landscape is vast, the diversity of clients is enormous, the standards we have to meet are sky-high, regulations are – rightly – increasingly stringent and we have to deal with many different stakeholders and interests.’\n\n‘A model is a simplified representation of reality. But that reality is a rather complex whole that is constantly changing, so that is our greatest challenge. “Keep it simple, stupid”, is what I always say. And if we can find the right balance between that transparent simplicity and that complex reality, we really make a difference. For a credit risk modeller, this is the moment where you can write history: this redevelopment of the model. There is a lot at stake.’\n\nThe human side of a technical profession\n\n‘In my team, that pressure creates an extra drive to perfect the model. I manage a team of 10 modellers. They program, mainly in Python, to perform the analyses to identify and quantify risks. I am the bridge between them, the management and other stakeholders. Such as the business, i.e. the people who use the models, but also IT for the implementation, the data team for the quality of the data, the validation team and audit. The latter two monitor the model content and process.’\n\n‘Personally, I find the network of stakeholders a very nice aspect of this profession. Risk analytics sounds quite technical, and in the core it is, but it is also very human. The complexity lies, on the one hand, in the quantitative puzzle itself and, on the other hand, in the interpretations and the various interests it represents. In the end, we all serve the client. And yes, we use advanced Python scripts, but we must always be able to explain it to everyone, including non-technical stakeholders. Whether it is senior management, the business or the regulator, the model must be as transparent and understandable as possible.’\n\nTogether for the best result\n\n‘I am incredibly proud of my team. The pressure is high, the dynamics matchless and the atmosphere is good! We are a very close team of very smart people from all over the world and we work very closely together. So, many stand-ups, round-table discussions and knowledge sharing meetings. We are critical and keep each other on our toes. Normally, we do a lot of fun things besides work. Covid has made that a little less, but we still have a lot of fun together.’\n\n‘That atmosphere contributes to everyone’s dedication to making this project a success. We did not miss a deadline, I am really proud of that. Everyone helps each other, within the team but also outside. This mentality is typical of Rabobank: we always make time for others, no matter how busy we are. There is a great awareness that you get the best results together, especially within risk analytics. From this profession, you are the most intertwined with all parts of the bank – and you feel that.’","createdAt":1701870794,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"7874efecc99a","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Making history as a credit risk modeller; it is happening now","image":{"_key":"bdcabe98c66d","_type":"image","alt":"Martin van Buren at the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-ccc8cc70ce78523775fcc33ba3f3fea67517c41f-2560x1267-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["social-innovation","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"Croeselaan 18","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00107297","city":"Utrecht","consent":["Data Retention - 2024","Voluntary gender-identification"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"nl","display_order":4,"label_de":"Niederlande","label_en":"The Netherlands","label_es":"Países Bajos","label_fr":"Pays-Bas","label_nl":"Nederland","label_pt":"Países Baixos"}],"date_start":1716897990712,"date_updated":1716897918544,"hours_max":"36","job_branch":[{"code":"it","display_order":1,"label_de":"IT","label_en":"IT","label_es":"TI","label_fr":"IT\u002FTechnologies de l’information","label_nl":"IT","label_pt":"TI"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"You could participate in architecting and implementing best fit Cloud solutions for AWS within  our bank.

That's where I got the chance to participate in this program and get a broader understanding of the bank. When the opportunity knocked, I welcomed it with open arms.\"","content":"Building on a broad foundation\n\n“Before starting this program, I was an analyst on a Rabobank team that focuses on acquisition financing for clients who are being taken over by private equity firms. These investment companies want to put a lot of equity capital into acquiring a majority share in a particular business. Rabobank can help them with financial resources. Acquisition financing is comparable to a mortgage, except it’s for businesses. It was an interesting position that I learned a lot from. But I’m so glad that I’m doing this program now, because I’m discovering how much more Rabobank has to offer Young Professionals like me. The program is helping me build a stronger foundation so I can become a versatile corporate banker.”\n\nProfessional and Personal Growth\n\n“Besides getting to know Rabobank better and getting broad work experience, I’m also getting to know myself better. This combination has helped me take massive leaps as a Young Professional. After all, personal development is at least equally important as professional developoment. During the program you get to work on your soft skills with other Young Professionals. Everything from participating in a training about leadership skills to talking about what you find difficult and which personal goals you would like to work on. I learned what my style of communication is and how to use it to work better in a team. I also discovered one of my weaknesses. I can develop tunnel vision a lot faster than other people. Now that I am aware of this characteristic though, it’s easier to watch out for it.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the program like?\n\n“In the beginning there are several days of introduction so we can get to know Rabobank better. One of the things we learn is what is important to the bank. Because Rabobank focuses on food & agri, during the introduction phase we learn what that means in practice for different departments. For example, granting loans can be linked to achieving sustainability targets. That demonstrates that the bank is more than a lending party; it’s also a valuable partner for companies.”\n\n“Another great thing about the program is that you get to know many other Young Professionals. We participate in a variety of training courses together and we share our experiences. In addition, the program offers the option of doing a rotation in a different department.”\n\nDiverse and Dynamic Work\n\n“I currently work in Acquisition Finance as a credit analyst. My work is diverse and challenging. I have my own portfolio of corporate clients who have loans with us. The value of these clients’ finance packages ranges between a few hundred million to billions of euros; the loans are financed by multiple banks and also partly financed by investors. My clients operate in different sectors, like retail, recruitment, and food & agri. I monitor their financial performance, check the risk profiles, and help the investment managers maintain the client relationship. If something is not right, it is my responsibility to promptly flag it within the bank. What that means in practice is that I do all sorts of applications and draw up reports for our department’s management and the risk department.”\n\n“I also work on new transactions, which is all about bringing in new clients. My job is to work with the deal team to secure internal approval for extending the loan. To do that, I research the new corporate client by reading reports about their business and sector, and I make financial projections based on their financial planning. That way we can accurately assess what the risk will be for the bank. This part of my job has taught me so much about stakeholder mangement because I get to work with so many different internal and external parties. That includes the Know Your Customer department (which is concerned with flagging fraud and money laundering) and the Legal department. I’m also in touch with outside parties like other banks, advisers, and lawyers. In short: this is such a dynamic environment.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the supervision like?\n\n“I have monthly meetings with the young talent manager who supervises me. We talk about how things are going at work, during trainings, and how my development is coming along in terms of my personal goals. The diverse group of Young Professionals also provides a valuable form of supervision. With so many different backgrounds, ambitions, and kinds of knowledge in one group, it enriches your existing network and expands it instantly. I wouldn’t want to miss out on this program for all the money in the world. I definitely see my development progressing, but I’m not yet sure what position I’d like to end up in. Thanks to the program, I have the opportunity to develop a good foundation as a banker while I also have access to the tools I need for further growth. That way, I can make better choices when it comes to my career.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1701706104,"updatedAt":1716553302,"representation":{"_key":"27ebec8d0daa","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Would you like to become a versatile banker through the Young Professional Program in Corporate Banking?","image":{"_key":"e4ddd71f9b8a","_type":"image","alt":"Young women is sitting behind laptop and looking into the camera","asset":{"_ref":"image-e842dc3ab8077b53ea2d1e4cbe9f1662b879e951-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["active-listening","business-analysis","business-strategies","credit-analysis","customer-analytics","data-insights","disciplined-execution","market-research","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"corporate-banking","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"Griffeweg 80","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00098048","city":"Groningen","consent":["Data retention","Voluntary gender-identification"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"nl","display_order":4,"label_de":"Niederlande","label_en":"The Netherlands","label_es":"Países Bajos","label_fr":"Pays-Bas","label_nl":"Nederland","label_pt":"Países Baixos"}],"date_start":1721035913903,"date_updated":1721035892145,"hours_max":"36","job_branch":[{"code":"customer-product","display_order":8,"label_de":"Customer & Product","label_en":"Customer & Product","label_es":"Cliente y producto","label_fr":"Client et Produit","label_nl":"Particulier & Zakelijk Klantadvies","label_pt":"Cliente e produto"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Adviseur Klantenservice MKB"}],"style":"normal"},{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"Wil jij een belangrijke schakel zijn voor de ondernemers in Groningen.

They also help refugees find a job.”\n\nI took the opportunity in the Netherlands to study IT, which I loved when I was young. In Syria I was also working with IT, more as a hobby. It was a big turning point in my life that changed everything. I believe when you do things you love, you will do them better. Love what you’re doing is so important to move on in life.”\n\n“Hack Your Future helped me find my first job, an internship for three months at Ticketing Group in Amsterdam. For me it was great to have a job after a year of arriving in the Netherlands. It gave me more energy to think about my life and to move forward. To me, being human is to be active. I don’t like to sit at home waiting for a job to come, you have to move forward yourself.”\n\nYoung Professional Program\n\n“When I walked around in Amsterdam I noticed Rabobank everywhere. I saw the offices, the advertising. Because I wanted to have a job to move forward, I decided to visit the website of Rabobank to see what’s possible. I read interviews with Rabobank employees and I read about the Young Professional Program. So even before I started my internship, I applied for the Young Professional Program IT (YPP IT) at Rabobank. when I started the internship, I got a call from one of the IT recruiters at the bank. I got through the first selection! After three additional interviews, I was selected to start in the YPP IT. The program started when my internship ended so this was a great next step for me.”\n\n“I am still in the YPP IT and I am working with my team on the mainframe computers of Rabobank. These are the systems that connect various crucial systems of the bank to each other. We have to make sure everything stays up and running. When something goes wrong, we can’t just turn it off and on again like you would do with your laptop. This mainframe is one of the vital systems of the bank. We have to maintain the machines and make sure everything keeps running smoothly. This is important for our internal processes and for the service to our customers.”\n\nFresh start\n\n“I had a fresh start in the Netherlands, with my wife and baby. Rabobank provided me with the opportunity to do something different and they believe in me. My mentor helps me to make me feel confident in my job, the team and outside the bank. I am still active at CyberSoek to give computer class to children in the neighbourhood which is rewarding. Rabobank and the Young Professional Program provide me with more than just a job, they help me become the best version of myself, both professionally and personally. It’s more than just working at a bank.”","createdAt":1701863994,"updatedAt":1716553248,"representation":{"_key":"03fee2f9ea87","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Do what you love and you'll do better","image":{"_key":"4608b38e818b","_type":"image","alt":"Yaseir Alkhwalda op straat","asset":{"_ref":"image-b39baa9c9ded03305cf21ac4f7d4060be6cb74e0-1920x1280-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["change-agility","cloud-computing","customer-focused","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","distributed-systems","information-technology-security","information-technology-strategies","problem-management","solution-architecture","technology-landscape"],"proofPoints":null,"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"245 Park Avenue","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00105656","city":"New York","consent":["Data Retention - 2024","US External Questionnaire V3.0"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"us","display_order":18,"label_de":"USA","label_en":"United States","label_es":"Estados Unidos","label_fr":"États-Unis","label_nl":"Verenigde Staten","label_pt":"Estados Unidos"}],"date_start":1716401496127,"date_updated":1721077830101,"hours_max":"40","job_branch":[{"code":"corporate-banking","display_order":10,"label_de":"Corporate Banking","label_en":"Corporate banking","label_es":"Banca corporativa","label_fr":"Corporate Banking\u002FServices bancaires aux entreprises","label_nl":"Corporate banking","label_pt":"Bancos corporativos"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"The Regulatory Affairs Business Risk Officer is a first line professional within the Wholesale Banking division managing and assisting the business with regulatory adherence with a strong focus on BSA\u002FAML, change management and people manager of a first line KYC team."}],"style":"normal"},{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Our Shared Future: "}],"style":"normal"},{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"\"This candidate will play a pivotal role for Rabobank to ensure compliance business risks are identified and mitigated for the first line.
