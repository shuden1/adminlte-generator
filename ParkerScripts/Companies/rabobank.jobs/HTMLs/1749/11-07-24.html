Traineeship: A 16-month journey to push your boundaries","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"rabobank-traineeship-a-16-month-journey-to-push-your-boundaries-federica-midi"},"intro":"Are you ready to break free from the conventional path and take your career to new heights? Federica Midi, from Italy, did just that when she joined the Rabobank Traineeship. With a background in finance and a passion for sustainability and innovation, the program was a perfect fit for her. “It's a fantastic opportunity for me to push my boundaries and grow as a young professional,\" Federica says.","content":"The Rabobank Traineeship offers a comprehensive learning experience that allows you to discover your strengths and gain a deeper understanding of banking. In the words of Federica: “The program is the best experience you can get to grow as a young professional.” She shares the highlights: “In 16 months you will work in 4 different departments, these are called ‘rotations’. You also get to follow lots of different training courses. From learning about credit risk management to soft skills, such as negotiation or networking.”\n\n“I think the traineeship is all about finding your sweet spot within the bank. The rotations, trainings, coffees, talks with your talent manager and other colleagues: all these activities are aimed at helping you develop the career that is best suited for your talent. The first two rotations are assigned to you. One in a familiar field or position, and the other in an area outside your expertise that you wish to explore. The final two rotations are chosen by you, giving you the opportunity to pursue your passions and interests. And if you're feeling adventurous, you even have the option to do a rotation abroad, depending on your preference. It's an exciting journey.”\n\n\n\nEmbrace the unknown\n\n“The program is designed to take you out of your comfort zone and introduce you to different areas of the bank,” Federica explains. Her first rotation was in IT, which was a stretch for her. “It didn’t fit my background at all! I got to work on the long-term strategy for the banking app, but I had no clue about information technology, platforms and how they work.” And that’s exactly the point, she explains. “It gets you out of your comfort zone, digging deep into complex things that you've never heard of before.”\n\n“My second rotation was more comfortable for me. It was in the team called Equity Capital Markets (ECM). This team helps other companies and organizations with their financial transactions involving stocks and shares. They do this by giving advice and helping with things like initial public offerings (IPOs), which is when a company first starts selling stocks to the public, and secondary offerings, which is when a company sells more stocks after the initial IPO. They also help with other types of financial transactions like convertible bonds and share buybacks, and use their knowledge of the market and financial information to create the best plan for each company they work with. I worked together with the juniors in the team on presentations for the clients, and with the seniors figuring out which content to highlight.”\n\n\n\nTaking ownership and getting support\n\n“In Italy, I used to work in a consulting role in finance, which gave me the experience to step up my game in this second rotation. Taking ownership of the projects you work on is important during the traineeship. I’ve noticed it’s part of the Rabobank culture: they expect you to be independent and as a trainee, you are the author of your development journey. You’re given the freedom to shape your career path, while you’re given the help and trust you need.”\n\n“As a trainee, you've got numerous people you can turn to,” Federica adds. This support network includes a personal mentor, a buddy who has gone through the program, talent managers and a supervisor in each team. “Additionally, you’re encouraged to reach out to people from all over the bank for information and advice.”\n\nNavigating a different culture\n\nWhat else did you learn? Federica jumps to answer the question. “It’s crucial that you express your issues, your concerns, and your propositions to the people you work with. I worked in countries and companies with a more hierarchical culture, in which it wasn’t easy to reach out to the head of a department or people with many years of experience. They wouldn’t easily make some time for you. In Rabobank, also very experienced professionals are happy to share their learnings, and wisdom with young professionals, and mentoring them. Networking is strongly encouraged.”\n\nAt the beginning of the traineeship, Federica found it difficult to approach a managing director or a head of a department directly. “This took a few trials to feel comfortable,\" she admits. “Before joining Rabobank, I thought that ‘juniors were juniors’. But now, I can confidently say, I dare to say my opinion, and I even challenge the views of people with more work experience,” she adds. “It's such a valuable learning point. I really enjoy working in an open and communicative work environment.”\n\n\n\nFun with an international crowd\n\nWorking with people from different cultural backgrounds is one of the most valuable aspects of the Rabobank Traineeship, according to Federica. “I enjoy working with people from different cultural backgrounds. I learn a lot from my Dutch colleagues, and there are other internationals here. I love seeing this more diverse side of the organization,” she shares.\n\n“I started my traineeship with 19 other trainees, and with many other young professionals who are following the same training programs. We've had awesome times together, doing sports activities such as beach volleyball tournaments, a trip to Schiermonnikoog and we visited Efteling theme park. You get to know different people throughout the bank because they organize drinks with different departments. We’re networking, asking questions and having fun at the same time. This makes connections between us much stronger, and it helps you to discover new things about yourself, too.”\n\n\n\nFocus on sustainability and innovation\n\nIt's a big day for Federica today as she starts a new rotation in the Sector Banking team, where she’ll be working on corporate finance within the food and agriculture sector. “I'm really excited about this opportunity,” she says. For Federica, joining the traineeship was about more than just learning about banking. It was also about finding a career that aligns with her values. “I was keen to work for an organization that is dedicated to sustainability and innovation,” she explains. “I truly believe that the financial industry has a crucial role to play in creating a better world. I'm proud to be a part of a bank that's at the forefront of this change.”","createdAt":1701080532,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"6681ee8cbfd6","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Rabobank Traineeship: A 16-month journey to push your boundaries","image":{"_key":"2e1efe0bd280","_type":"image","alt":"Young female professional is standing outside in front of Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-fedcd7a424685f7db97f0a56b5df3182c24fadf3-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":null,"language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"654094e9-b5dc-45ea-8757-f77546e90e37","title":"How you want to be one step ahead of hackers as Security Specialist ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"i-always-want-to-be-one-step-ahead-of-hackers"},"intro":"Varsha Choudhary works with other IT security specialists on the Global Security Monitoring Team to protect Rabobank's applications and systems. They continuously improve the bank's digital defence walls.","content":"“While I was studying for my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering, my fellow students were mostly interested in coding and programming. I thought that was cool too, but I wanted to be different and started working towards my goal of becoming a Security Specialist.”\n\n“I worked hard to gain knowledge of networks, different operating systems, how to exploit vulnerabilities, and so on. After my studies, I started out as a developer, but I worked hard and through further studies I finally reach my goal. Currently, I work as an IT Security Specialist, protecting the bank from cyberattacks and hackers.”\n\nDeveloping within the bank\n\n“Within Rabobank, my knowledge of networks, different operating systems and even programming is very useful. I chose cyber security at Rabobank because we work with different tools, such as SIEM. This allows me to increase my knowledge of different tools and develop further. I see myself moving through Rabobank as an electron: everyone shares knowledge, and you can participate in other teams to enhance your skills further.”\n\n\n\nWorking together on cyber security\n\n“As security specialists, we protect the bank by understanding how a hacker thinks. We always try to be one step ahead of them. To do that, we have a threat hunting team, a security monitoring team and a team that performs vulnerability scanning and penetration tests. My job is to lay the groundwork for our threat hunters. If the rules in SIEM tool are incorrect, they can’t do their job. We therefore work with digital maps, on which we inform each other about our work. This keeps our work streamlined, and the bank secure.”\n\n\n\nGlobal protection leads to stability\n\n“I like the idea that in our work we protect Rabobank globally: we also work for other regions, like North America, Brazil and Australia. We contribute to stability. Customers must be able to trust their bank, and because of our efforts, they can be sure that their information and money are safe. But the development of data and technology is moving so quickly that it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect that data. We are getting smarter all the time in monitoring and defence, but hackers are also constantly improving their attacks. That’s why we always want to be one step ahead of hackers.”\n\nWorking together in an open culture\n\n“I think that the reason the cooperation between teams is so good is that we have a very open culture at the bank. I notice that colleagues trust our team. They really pay attention to what we say, and there is room for criticism. We also receive a lot of constructive feedback. We celebrate our successes together, and what I like very much: I have never have to dress formally here. I can be myself. The open culture also means that I dare to ask about new opportunities within the bank, and I know that I can achieve my goals here.”","createdAt":1704376162,"updatedAt":1704376432,"representation":{"_key":"fc72bc1a0537","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"How you want to be one step ahead of hackers as Security Specialist ","image":{"_key":"9693f49c673c","_type":"image","alt":"Women is posing","asset":{"_ref":"image-9d574620495e107f505bdc219b318bf331bb0d37-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"subvakgebied","id":"a0069902-25f4-491f-ad93-e1ecc942b39b","title":"FEC Change & Implemen­tation","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"kyc-change-support"},"vakgebiedSlug":{"current":"financial-economic-crime","_type":"slug"},"intro":"The colleagues from Financial Economic Crime (FEC) would not be able to perform as they do without the people of Change & Implementation.

Roxana van Mourik, recruiter at Rabobank, is the perfect person to talk about diversity and inclusion at Rabobank. 'We need role models in visible positions.'\n\n","content":"Update: As of November 2022, Roxana is no longer a recruiter, but a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Associate. In this position, she deals with diversity and inclusion.\n\nSpicing things up a bit at the Croeselaan\n\n“As a recruiter I talk to people to see if they are a match for Rabobank. I work in the wholesale domain, which is internationally oriented. Many job interviews are in English and that makes my work very varied. Before the corona crisis I used to have the interviews at the office, but now of course I do them mainly from home.”\n\n“Lately we are able to go to the office a bit more often. I travel with my guide dog Magic by public transport. By train I get to Rabobank’s head office in fifteen minutes. Magic sits under my desk all day long. Together we spice things up a bit, I always say as a joke.”\n\nJust a regular application\n\n“If I have an appointment for a physical interview, I inform people in advance that I am blind and that my dog is with me. There have been times when I’ve met someone who was very afraid of dogs. It is useful to know this in advance. Of course, you don’t come across a recruiter with my disability very often. People think it’s super cool that I work at such a big bank.”\n\n“I often get asked how I ended up in this job. I found my first job as a recruiter through an organization for people with a disability, but I came to Rabobank through my own network. I knew a recruiter who worked there and presented him with my resume. That’s how the ball started rolling!”\n\nFull participation\n\n“A disability is often seen as a disadvantage, which means that people do not feel comfortable being open about it. And yet you can often make a unique contribution to the work and the company culture. I am just a recruiter who also happens to be blind. We need role models in visible positions to make it clear that Rabobank is open to people with a disability or distance to the labor market and offers all kinds of facilities for them.”\n\n“As a Rabobank employee, you can contact the Inclusive Support Desk for support. I have special software on my laptop that reads out letters and resumes and a braille display. This is a device that you click to your computer that converts text to braille. I also have a special access pass that makes the gates stay open longer, so I can easily pass through with Magic. Of course, this is also useful for people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations.”\n\n“People just don’t know how difficult all kinds of ordinary work is for people with disabilities. When I started, many systems were not accessible for people with a visual impairment and I could only do my work through all kinds of workarounds. This has gotten much better. We have switched to different software, which is accessible. I am now the expert to whom people come and ask how they should do certain things! I can really do my job as a full-fledged recruiter.”\n\nThe importance of accessibility\n\n“Since I joined the team, my colleagues have become more aware of the importance of accessibility. For example, we recently found out that we were being seriously spammed on job applications for certain positions: sometimes you get the same application 30 or 40 times. It is very time-consuming to filter these out. To prevent this, we put a captcha in place. In those cases I emphasize on the option of an audio version, so that the application form remains accessible to people with visual impairments.”\n\nAmbitions for the future\n\n“My colleagues are generally very open-minded. Rabobank is a cooperative bank and you can see that approach in the people who work there. The bank’s mission is ‘Growing a better world together’; in my opinion, diversity and inclusion at Rabobank are an important part of that. But I do think we still talk a little too much and take too little action. I have more and more colleagues with disabilities, but there are still far too few of them. That number has to go up, and not just by saying it’s important, but by really taking action.”\n\n“I previously had a recruitment role where I focused on people with disabilities. Now that I’ve been working at wholesale for a while, I notice that I want to do more with that again. I see myself pulling the cart at Rabobank. My ambition is to get a good managerial position, where I can determine the strategy and say: `Hey guys, this is how we’re going to do it’. That’s my distant dot on the horizon, that seems very cool.”\n\n\n\nInclusive Support Desk\n\n\nWithin Rabobank, the Inclusive Support Desk is an important place for colleagues with special needs. Frans van den Top and Meryem Bakirhan help Rabobank employees with their questions. “These are employees with visual of auditory impairments, or mobility impairments. And colleagues who are neurodiverse or have some form of dyslexia.”, Frans said.\n\n“We offer support to employees with an extra challenge and we help managers when hiring employees with an extra challenge. In addition, we take care of the accessibility of our IT systems, the workplace and our buildings. For example, we can help in adaptations to the elevators or the entrance gates.”\n\nThe Inclusive Desk fills a need according to Frans, “We see an influx of people with a distance to the labor market and we also want them to participate fully in our daily business. We help everyone with a disability.”\n\nThe work of the Inclusive Support Desk is not going unnoticed. Rabobank has been nominated for the CTalents Diamond Awards. Recognizing those who truly make a difference and are committed to inclusion in the workplace. The award ceremony will take place in April 2022.","createdAt":1700834702,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"fb53005eeeae","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"I'm just a recruiter who happens to be blind","image":{"_key":"e0567acd719d","_type":"image","alt":"Roxana van Mourik - Braille ","asset":{"_ref":"image-1232405e43af5b753940f06b2f3dbb06a7b3f0d2-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-analysis","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","policy-implementation","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"hr","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"bb012673-ba95-4d50-94da-ae0cdb20b3b5","title":"Thinking along and pushing back: how Credit Core is changing teamwork within the bank","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"credit-core-transforms-the-way-people-work-together"},"intro":"A loan for a start-up that is rejected in Utrecht but approved in Amersfoort. Previously, each local bank managed its business in its own way. Globalization and a strict supervisory authority make this situation unmanageable. Rabobank is addressing this on a large scale with the Credit Core program.","content":"What is Credit Core?\n\n“Credit Core is an innovative way to make improvements in managing credit risk – one of the bank’s core processes. We can add any type of functionality to Credit Core. From new legislation and regulations to different types of customer segmentations or product types.” explains Jesse van Egmond, Team Lead of the Credit Initiatives Team. “The Initiatives Team is a strategic team that identifies the major themes around credit risk. It then passes on the work to different areas in the Tribe Credit Core.”\n\n\n\n“An initiative is the most abstract level in an agile way of working. We map out the initiatives. We look at how a theme fits within the tribe. Where it touches the customer journey and our products. We make themes concrete and pass them on to one of the areas or squads. They implement the final solutions as policy, or into processes and IT systems.”\n\nThat’s where Angela Abdoelhafiezkhan, Team Lead IT of the Area Credit Core, comes in. “My area deals with everything related to client assessment. We make sure that our end users have the right tools to stay in control of their financial situation. And that they have the right reports to be accountable to our regulators.”\n\n“End users are not just corporate clients and local banks. Rabobank has business units on every continent and global stakeholders such as Wholesale or Rural. all of which have their own credit limit systems. We’re bringing this together in Credit Core. It goes through every fiber of our organization. It has been named “Critical Executive Programme” by the Group Management for a reason. It’s really a large-scale process.”\n\nWhy is it needed?\n\nAngela: “There are different systems for the same kind of processes. However, globally we have to meet strict requirements and ensure that our end users are more ”in control”. It is also important that we work in a future-proof, efficient and uniform way. Which ultimately works to the advantage of both our customers and the bank.”\n\nJesse: “It had become almost impossible to implement necessary changes. Colleagues were doing the same work in different places. That could cause the same loan application to be rejected at one local bank but approved at another branch. That’s not only disastrous for your efficiency, but also for the overall cost. With Credit Core, we can set up credit risk management in a standardized and centralized way.”\n\nSimplify@Scale: a new way of working\n\nUnder the name Simplify@Scale, agile working was rolled out on a large scale within Rabobank at the end of 2020. Jesse: “Apart from the organizational structure, it’s a transition to a whole new way of working. Previously, employees in a policy team only worked on policy. This is no longer the case. It really does ask a lot from people.”\n\n\n\n“In the squads you work directly with colleagues from process, business or IT. You have to be open to that. The most important skill you have to have is to be able to connect people. Dare to compromise. Unite different perspectives. Being aware that there is no one right answer.”\n\n\n\nAngela agrees, “Working well together and having the drive to continuously improve is an absolute ‘must’ to help the Tribe Credit Core get ahead. We believe it is important for our employees to accelerate. We are looking for people who are pioneers in their field, who think along with us but also push back. That’s why we encourage entrepreneurship according to the ‘learning by doing’ principle. In other words, it’s better to try something with a chance of failure, than to wait and not make an impact.”\n\nChallenging jobs\n\nRabobank has 9.6 million customers and operates in 37 countries. That’s why Area Credit Core is growing rapidly. Jesse: “I am looking for people who can play a connecting role, mainly within the bank. Specifically, we are looking for Product Owners. That’s a challenging role within the Tribe, it’s really something you have to grow into. A good product owner is worth their weight in gold.”\n\nAngela complements him: “We need different types of IT professionals to join our brand new tribe. Business analysts, software engineers, solution architects, cloud engineers, and so on. But also new graduates are welcome. Preferably with a college or university IT degree and an adventurous and eager to learn attitude. The work is more than just making software. It requires a certain mindset. You have to dare to make a difference. Take on the challenge of making the bank rock solid.”\n\n“We are very involved in recruitment. This works both ways. We often ask people from the team to conduct the initial interview. They are good at assessing whether there is a match. Both in terms of content and person. This is followed by interviews with the supervisor and possibly an area lead. The advantage for the applicant is that you immediately get a good picture of your future colleagues.”\n\nWhy work at Rabobank?\n\nJesse: “As a cooperation, we are not listed on the stock exchange. This means we can deal with customers and employees of the bank in a different way. When you need to make a profit, it puts pressure on the organization and on the way people work with each other. That’s not the case with us. At our bank, customer and employee value come first.”\n\nAngela: “There are a lot of opportunities within the bank. We invest in the personal development of our employees. It’ s up to you to capitalize on the opportunities you get.”\n\n“The Tribe is multi-disciplinary. We want to cross the finish line together. The atmosphere is all about helping each other and our diversity makes us unique and powerful. You definitely want to be a part of that!”","createdAt":1704372434,"updatedAt":1704372986,"representation":{"_key":"733b5a9ee70a","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Thinking along and pushing back: how Credit Core is changing teamwork within the bank","image":{"_key":"18cccb2a4999","_type":"image","alt":"Colleagues are walking in front of Rabobank head office","asset":{"_ref":"image-beca0c714c5ef02ea11b8e88c9c4c54b017348bf-1360x920-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","way-of-working"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"378a6915-ca84-4e83-8b5c-85973eabe449","title":"Design the bank of the future as a Business Architect","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"design-the-bank-of-the-future-as-a-business-architect"},"intro":"Creating a vision of what business processes should look like several years from now is the task of Business Architect Joost Landman. “If we wouldn’t be here, that wouldn’t be a big deal in the short term. In the medium term, it would become annoying. And in the long run, disastrous. Because then no one would have worked on building the future.”","content":"The field of Business Architecture concerns three elements, Joost explains. The structure of IT systems, the business processes that support them, and the people who work with them. “As a Business Architect, I don’t provide the IT, but rather the vision of what IT and its processes should look like in a few years. That’s what enterprise architecture is about”.\n\nFast, efficient and accurate\n\nEach business architect at Rabobank has their own domain. “I work in the Wholesale & Rural domain, which deals with wholesale clients who are based abroad and are usually related to the food chain. This includes food production, transportation and processing, but also large farms from Australia and Brazil. The business architecture under my care deals with the application and management process of these clients’ loans. It has to be as fast, efficient and accurate as possible.”\n\n\n\nMake the process work\n\nWithin this process, Joost is looking into the systems related to the application form. “And that’s not a simple form, but a huge mountain of data, from which you have to extract the right decision parameters. So that you are able to present it to someone who ultimately decides whether or not we will do business with the client.”\n\nJoost explains more about the nature of this data. “There are all kinds of issues to deal with between offer and concluded loan. Who should approve this client? And on what basis? We also perform risk and capital calculations, and for that we need to have a good understanding of the client’s business structure and financial data. Getting all that data on a scratch book or in an Excel file takes too much time. With automation and optimizations, we make this process workable.”\n\nThe dream: an end-to-end application process\n\nThe dot on the horizon? Joost refers to the beginning of the conversation. “That’s what I mean by designing the future. What we’re doing now doesn’t exist yet. A complete end-to-end application process, that’s the dream.” Joost adds that for him it’s about more than the end result. “The result is going to take years. For me, the moment of success is earlier, when I know the direction we want to go.”\n\n\n\nListen and be curious\n\nWhat qualities come in handy as a business architect? “People often think of the complex, analytical part of the job first. Of course that’s part of it, but always in consultation with colleagues. Not only are you curious about systems and processes, but you also want to know how other people think about them. The work is a lot of listening and talking (and in that order!) to arrive at the right insights.”\n\nComplex business, continuous challenges\n\nWhen asked what makes this work so interesting, Joost doesn’t have to think long. “It’s incredible to be working on the bank of the future. Rabobank is a large and complex company with continuous challenges. Not just from a regulatory perspective, but because we want to innovate as a company. The design challenges involved are simply fantastic.”\n\n","createdAt":1704375536,"updatedAt":1705055142,"representation":{"_key":"26ddc213afeb","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Design the bank of the future as a Business Architect","image":{"_key":"2585b701ae2b","_type":"image","alt":"Joost is posing","asset":{"_ref":"image-9df80d07a5f684c59238009b5d151a1f7f8bfa8a-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"a631653a-6087-40cf-9cec-caa5e1e6e2c3","title":"Business Intelligence Translator: The indispensable translation of data to dashboard","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"business-intelligence-translator-de-waardevolle-vertaalslag-van-data-naar-dashboard"},"intro":"Robbert van Drunen is Business Intelligence (BI) Translator within Rabobank's data-rich environment. His talent for turning raw data into clear information shows in his work, his expertise goes beyond graphs and figures. Above all, his work demonstrates the added value he brings to his team and working environment.","content":"In a team consisting of developers, architects, business intelligence translators, a product owner, and a scrum master, Robbert, as BI Translator, converts raw data into clear insights for the bank's management. Specifically when it comes to operations, Robbert explains: “Business Intelligence as a field delivers concrete information about how Rabobank is operating as an organization.”\n\nA visual translation\n\nRobbert works for the Financial Economic Crime (FEC) domain, specifically for the department that handles fraud. “Fraud gets reported by customers or picked up by our detection systems. It's up to us to turn this raw data into insights about how much work it will generate for the teams. We present this data visually, with charts and dashboards, so that management can see how much work the teams have, the level of backlog, and ultimately, whether KPI targets are being met.”\n\nTwo-way traffic\n\nRobbert's translation goes both ways. With data as the focal point, he maneuvers from one side to the other: from the source (the FEC department) to management and back. He determines what data is needed depending on what management requires. With the right data in hand, a dashboard is set up and the data is communicated to management. “Besides offering insight, we are in touch with both sides: the department the data comes from as well as management,” he says.\n\nConscious use of resources\n\nProcessing, storing, scaling, and sharing data – that’s what happens in the cloud. Robbert's team is committed to sustainable data processing. “With the cloud, you get to operate the knobs yourself and decide how hard it should work. Small resources do not require much energy for data processing. So we turn the knobs down a bit to be ready on time for customers, but we don't use energy unnecessarily.”\n\nThe team applies this approach by scaling down data processing after 7:00 a.m. “Outside peak or office hours, we don't need to process data, so we make more efficient and careful use of our resources. After 7:00, the focus is on dashboard availability.” This is how Robbert's team contributes to sustainability: “Using our resources consciously, that's what it's all about.”\n\nKeep developing\n\nRobbert is also working on his personal development. “You get a lot of freedom to shape your role and development as you think best. You can take courses and trainings both internally and externally. To get started, you can take a personal development test, for example.” Robbert points out that proactivity is important. “It doesn’t just fall into your lap, you have to go and get it. That's how I trained as a Product Owner.”\n\nValue creation\n\nWhat gives Robbert the most satisfaction in his work is clear: “Delivering value to customers, the freedom to translate a need into a solution, the realization that this solution can help others move forward. In fact, we provide the insights that allow others to do their jobs better. At FEC, our job is to keep money on the right path. Contributing in that way to the team and the environment is energizing!”","createdAt":1701865304,"updatedAt":1702993370,"representation":{"_key":"572a3264b04c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"title":"The indispensable translation of data to dashboard","label":"article","image":{"_key":"747d30a703ab","_type":"image","alt":"Robbert van Drunen (Business Intelligence Translator) outside Rabobank.","asset":{"_ref":"image-6239c0ad167f263556f340e23e5bc45ff6660808-2048x1365-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-acumen","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","data-modeling","data-quality","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","programming-languages","requirements-analysis","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["personal-development"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"subvakgebied","id":"355237fa-5b7e-4129-93b7-19bb6d0ed2fa","title":"Transaction monitoring","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"anti-money-laundering"},"vakgebiedSlug":{"current":"financial-economic-crime","_type":"slug"},"intro":"The TM department is part of our Financial Economic Crime (FEC) organization.

In Amersfoort you automatically end up at Crackerjacks.”\n\nIt was a small, quiet club; besides training and playing matches, not much happened there. I thought that was a real pity. A sports club is a great place to develop not only in sports but also socially. You make friends there, and go do things together after the game.”\n\n“That’s what I talked about with other parents during matches or training sessions. We all wanted our children to be able to look back on a fun time later on, a welcoming club, wonderful friendships. That was my motivation to volunteer to join the board, along with some other parents.”\n\nHow to start?\n\n“We took the first steps together with Rabo Clubsupport. This is a Rabobank initiative that helps sports clubs with knowledge and support in all sorts of areas. When you want to make your clubhouse more sustainable or want to recruit sponsors, for example. We especially needed a clear plan for the future. Rabo Clubsupport helped us to put this vision on paper.”\n\n“Our goal was focused on the community. How can we make this sport more visible outside and how can we involve the neighborhoods of Amersfoort? Everything came together in 3×3 basketball. In this form of basketball, two teams of three players each play against each other on a half court with one basket. And 3×3 basketball is played outside, on public basketball fields in your own neighborhood. The threshold for getting to know the game is much lower there than indoors.”\n\n“With our plans under our belt, we went to the city council. They were enthusiastic: we were given an outdoor basketball court to manage and that’s where it all started!”\n\nWhere we’re at\n\n“What started with one basketball court has now grown into four courts and a complete training program for young people. During the summer months we train small groups of young people on the basketball courts to become trainers: 3×3 leaders. They learn how to teach kids basketball, but also: how to involve young people in the game, how to get them to participate in the squares, and how to make them feel welcome. The 3×3 leaders are role models, who pass on their pleasure in basketball to others. The fact that we can offer this space and these opportunities to young people in the neighbourhood, motivates me enormously to continue my efforts.”\n\n“Every time, exciting new initiatives arise. For example, we brightened up one of our courts with a work of art with the help of street art collective Concrete Canvas and the Amersfoort artist JipPiet . The young people who play basketball with us have also been involved in this. It gives them a sense of ownership, they like coming back to ‘their’ basketball court.”\n\n“At Rabobank, you get the opportunity to make a social contribution locally. For me, it’s incredibly important to do that in the city where I live, in Amersfoort. I think that applies to many colleagues, hopefully I motivate them with the stories about my club. It would be nice if they use it as an inspiration to also do something for a sports club or other association in their own area.”\n\nDo you have a tip for other clubs?\n\n“Look into what people are capable of and make use of their talents. When we had a big event, the photographer was a parent who I knew liked to take pictures. And I asked someone with little knowledge of basketball but a lot of understanding of communications to join the technical committee.” It makes Adrie laugh. “The technical committee arranges trainers, for example, but does not tell them how things work in the club. It was nice for her to be able to respond to that. It was a golden move.”","createdAt":1701428355,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"c6a600530a3c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Adrie van Wonderen with a basketball","asset":{"_ref":"image-d85dcf616ec2fcaf6336ed9caf0acc3ee49deed3-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"Working on a better world starts in your own community"},"skills":["audit-methodology","business-acumen","change-agility","communication","data-insights","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance","risk-management","root-cause-analysis-rca","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["social-innovation"],"vakgebied":"customer-product","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"abcc00b1-eb67-420b-ae6a-d3525cd7736e","title":"Intern Camillo","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"stagiair-camillo"},"intro":"Camillo, an intern within RaboResearch Europe & Africa, shares his experience.

They enable data-driven and adequate decision making. This is what makes Modelling Consultant Paula enjoy her work. Navigating her way through a complex web of internal and external stakeholders, she works hard to contribute to the development of the best possible predictive models. She comes from Lithuania, but Rabobank feels like home to her, thanks to the close community of like-minded data professionals she's part of. She wouldn't trade her job for the world and is happy to share why.","content":"Being the linking pin\n\n‘Working in the field of Data Science is truly one of the most exciting things you can do within the bank. As a Modelling Consultant I’m responsible for supporting the development and maintenance of Rabobank’s credit risk models. It’s an extremely versatile job because our models have a big impact and are interwoven with pretty much every business department and their processes. We are truly the heart of the bank and I’m in the middle of it all. The linking pin within a very extensive and dynamic stakeholder field.’\n\n‘Important stakeholders are the colleagues who actually need to work with our credit risk models. Analysts, who determine whether and what type of loan a client gets, for example, or make capital calculations with the help of our models. We also work closely with the data team to make processes more efficient. For the implementation of the models, we turn to colleagues from IT. And for independent internal challenge, there are dedicated model validation and audit teams. Finally, there’s an external stakeholder from who we need approval: the ECB. The challenge for me is to keep close contact with all these stakeholders and make sure the process of model development runs smoothly within a complex quantitative and regulatory framework. Hereby ensuring that business needs are being met.’\n\nThe necessity of models\n\n‘To explain the function of a model, I always refer to the essence of banking: helping people and society financially. By providing loans or credit facilities, Rabobank helps people to run their business or buy a house. But loans obviously carry risks. That’s where models come in. We use credit risk models to predict the probability that a client won’t be able to pay back their loan and what the expected loss would be for the bank, all based on data. A lot of data. So to make these estimations manually would be a very complex and inefficient exercise. Models are indispensable for banking. Without them, Rabobank would never be as efficient as it is now.’\n\nData-driven, compliant decision making\n\n‘To me, this job really matters. Models are the driving force behind the bank, because practically every aspect of banking depends on it, for example, client acceptance, pricing, capital calculations. They are used in everyday business processes, supporting effective, data-driven and compliant decision making for us to be and stay a future-proof bank. Therefore it’s a huge responsibility to make accurate and trustworthy predictions with our credit risk models. Not only the quality of our products depends on it, but the way we help clients and the way we fulfill our role in society as a financial institution.’\n\nAnalytics community\n\n‘Another aspect that makes my work so valuable, is the team. We all have a different background in education, culture and age, but we also have a lot in common. What I love is that we challenge each other to stay on our toes. We are eager to learn, to teach and we encourage each other.’\n\n‘Because of our shared talents, interests, and our close collaboration, I feel like I’m part of an analytics community within Rabobank. This feeling is a big part of what keeps me motivated and interested. I’m from Lithuania originally, and my family lives over there. But my team over here is so much fun, I see them as my work family. A family of highly intelligent and kind people. ‘\n\n","createdAt":1701165033,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"9d4f41a73038","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working at the heart of the bank, making it future-proof with predictive models","image":{"_key":"5ac9e3ad56f0","_type":"image","alt":"Paule outside at cycling path in front of Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-4f3a0dfcfc8d617aa0907a3fd666d38b488b8100-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"traineeship","id":"560a3541-29a8-42e0-825a-cad528de5630","title":"Global Traineeship","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"global-traineeship"},"intro":"The Rabobank Global Traineeship is an opportunity to get to know the different departments within the bank and contribute to a better future.\n\n","content":"What will you be doing?\n\nThe aim of this traineeship is to better get to know yourself and the bank.

He wrote his graduation thesis on self-driving cars, but he passed by the turnoff to the automotive industry. He preferred to use his talent to make a social impact. He chose a career at Rabobank.","content":"“During my master’s, I already learned more about programming and the abstract, mathematical side. I noticed how much I enjoyed the aspect of controlling systems. I wanted to put that into practice.” Eloy was part of the start of FEC Tech and has experienced the growth of the field from the beginning. “We started with a handful of people and had to figure everything out. Because of that, it sometimes felt like I was working at a startup.”\n\n\nWholesale & Rural\n\nIn the meantime, the FEC team has grown and split into sub-teams. Within Transaction Monitoring (TM), Eloy, along with 10 others, is part of the Wholesale & Rural team. “The international part of AML Transaction Monitoring”, where Eloy and colleagues focus on transactions of large corporate customers in Brazil and London. How does that work? Eloy: “Every day, files come in on our servers that contain information about customers and transactions. This data is processed by scripts that check for correct data and with that data we build customer profiles. These profiles give us insight into what normal behavior is for a certain type of customer. With individual customers, like you and me, we mainly see pin transactions and the like. With companies, we see a lot of transactions with other companies.”\n\n\n\n\nDetection Rules\n\nAs FEC Tech Business Analyst, Eloy now has a coordinating and advisory role. “Yet I still enjoy solving technical issues and coming up with creative solutions. I am now mainly involved in more complex tasks, such as developing new detection rules. This includes, for example: identifying relevant risks and creating pseudocode for functional detection.”\n\nThe detection rules that Eloy talks about are not just applicable anywhere. “Each industry has its own set of rules that produce alerts. These alerts include a piece of code that points to potentially suspicious behavior of the customer. So, if there is an unusual activity or there is a strange party involved, we ensure that it is further investigated.”\n\n\n\nMaking an Impact\n\nIn addition to the impact that Eloy makes as FEC Tech Business Analyst, he contributes to society in another way. “I find sustainability very important and interesting. That’s why I started a Young Professional Program at Global Compact, a spin-off organization of the UN. Global Compact focuses on achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.”\n\n\n\n“Together with professionals from other companies, I am following a program at Global Compact for a year. We meet each other every two weeks, digitally or on location, with each participant alternating as host.” Soon it will be Eloy’s turn. “I’m going to speak, but I will also invite colleagues to do so. For example, at the Lead Road to Paris event, a team member talked about Transaction Monitoring and another colleague spoke about intuitive leadership.”\n\nThe culture at FEC tech\n\nEloy speaks openly about the good atmosphere at FEC Tech. “We have a very young, close-knit team, that also sees eachother outside of work hours. We sometimes play Dungeons & Dragons, there is a game night every quarter, and we regularly eat pizza together.” So, a team full of enthusiasts. “There are just a lot of young people who are excited! The good atmosphere, the technical aspect, and the fact that you can contribute to society, makes me recommend this work to everyone.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711454922,"updatedAt":1714124226,"representation":{"_key":"15416bd3f214","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Eloy","asset":{"_ref":"image-f08308d8d6a1532856b12b86bd0e0d65994afdbd-6494x4329-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.9559215646243415,"width":0.5610727806613872,"x":0.5,"y":0.5}},"label":"article","title":"Sustainability and detection rules: Business Analist (FEC Tech) Eloy"},"skills":["business-analysis","business-networking","business-process-improvements","data-insights","requirements-analysis","solution-architecture"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"traineeship","id":"104c5c67-6cb7-476b-a9a6-f1008f9136e5","title":"Finance","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"finance"},"intro":"Are you a recent graduate with a passion for finance and a desire to make a difference?
