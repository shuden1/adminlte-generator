Nina Bussmann is a down-to-earth woman from Twente whose heart beats faster when she solves a technical issue that reduces the risk of money laundering. As a data scientist, she tinkers daily with one of the models that Rabobank uses to keep money on the right track.","content":"Recognizing money laundering risks\n\n“Financial and economic crime is a broad term,” Nina explains. “I am in the TM team: Transaction Monitoring, which includes money laundering and terrorist financing. As data scientists, we are building the risk model that monitors transactions and identifies suspicious ones. That model consists of very specialised software with its own algorithm, calculation rules in programming language. With these rules, we teach the model to recognize money laundering risks in data, as it were.”\n\nNina mentions the catering industry as an example. “There is a lot of cash in circulation in this sector, so the origin cannot always be traced. This also means that there is an increased risk of money laundering. We, as a bank, must act against this. So we build a new rule into our model that takes this risk into account.”\n\nTinkering at the back\n\n“I work on the 'back' of the model. My colleagues and I make sure the algorithm works properly. A lot is happening, so there are new risks every day. We are tinkering every day. And rules that go into production identify all transactions in real time from that moment on.” Nina is beaming. “This is quite exciting, as the model processes an average of more than 10 million transactions per day. If I put something into production, and it works, that really gives me a kick.”\n\nTechnologically challenging and socially relevant\n\nNina is clearly enthusiastic about her profession. “There are so many facets that I find interesting. FEC is still a relatively young field and technologically very challenging. There is a lot of money in circulation worldwide, and that means a lot of data and complex issues for us. We are constantly developing, always innovating. This gives me the opportunity to specialize more and more in TM as a data scientist.”\n\n“I also find FEC very interesting because it is so relevant. It is very motivating to open Het Financieel Dagblad (a Dutch financial newspaper) in the morning and read about money laundering. That makes me very aware of the value of our work.”\n\nThe advantages of a large cooperation\n\nWhy Rabobank? “It is a big bank, which means big impact. But it also feels familiar. I am from Twente and my parents were already customers at the Boerenleenbank. Rabobank was founded as a cooperative, and you can feel that. The solidarity above all. We celebrate successes together and when things go wrong we solve them together. You are never alone. I really like that.”\n\nNina about her team: “I work in a small, young and driven team. Not at all what you expect from a bank, but it is sometimes like working in a start-up. We make a lot possible in a short time and are given the space to innovate and develop. We have the security of a large employer, but also the means to move quickly and make the model more and more sophisticated. That is a real advantage. The bank underlines the importance of FEC and is committed to keeping the financial system as clean as possible. We are also reaping the benefits of that.” \n\n","createdAt":1701071513,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"444e2278a438","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Identifying money laundering risks in 10 million transactions per day","image":{"_key":"2cb303c9cb7e","_type":"image","alt":"Nina Bussman - poseert","asset":{"_ref":"image-6982666cad8e655464c4f4cf96a502bce84e3b9d-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-analysis","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","policy-implementation","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"aa1a48f3-4ddd-488a-a1a9-1ecd10cac333","title":"Working at the heart of the bank, making it future-proof with predictive models","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-at-the-heart-of-the-bank-making-it-future-proof-with-predictive-models"},"intro":"Credit risk models: the bank depends on them.

Navigating her way through a complex web of internal and external stakeholders, she works hard to contribute to the development of the best possible predictive models. She comes from Lithuania, but Rabobank feels like home to her, thanks to the close community of like-minded data professionals she's part of. She wouldn't trade her job for the world and is happy to share why.","content":"Being the linking pin\n\n‘Working in the field of Data Science is truly one of the most exciting things you can do within the bank. As a Modelling Consultant I’m responsible for supporting the development and maintenance of Rabobank’s credit risk models. It’s an extremely versatile job because our models have a big impact and are interwoven with pretty much every business department and their processes. We are truly the heart of the bank and I’m in the middle of it all. The linking pin within a very extensive and dynamic stakeholder field.’\n\n‘Important stakeholders are the colleagues who actually need to work with our credit risk models. Analysts, who determine whether and what type of loan a client gets, for example, or make capital calculations with the help of our models. We also work closely with the data team to make processes more efficient. For the implementation of the models, we turn to colleagues from IT. And for independent internal challenge, there are dedicated model validation and audit teams. Finally, there’s an external stakeholder from who we need approval: the ECB. The challenge for me is to keep close contact with all these stakeholders and make sure the process of model development runs smoothly within a complex quantitative and regulatory framework. Hereby ensuring that business needs are being met.’\n\nThe necessity of models\n\n‘To explain the function of a model, I always refer to the essence of banking: helping people and society financially. By providing loans or credit facilities, Rabobank helps people to run their business or buy a house. But loans obviously carry risks. That’s where models come in. We use credit risk models to predict the probability that a client won’t be able to pay back their loan and what the expected loss would be for the bank, all based on data. A lot of data. So to make these estimations manually would be a very complex and inefficient exercise. Models are indispensable for banking. Without them, Rabobank would never be as efficient as it is now.’\n\nData-driven, compliant decision making\n\n‘To me, this job really matters. Models are the driving force behind the bank, because practically every aspect of banking depends on it, for example, client acceptance, pricing, capital calculations. They are used in everyday business processes, supporting effective, data-driven and compliant decision making for us to be and stay a future-proof bank. Therefore it’s a huge responsibility to make accurate and trustworthy predictions with our credit risk models. Not only the quality of our products depends on it, but the way we help clients and the way we fulfill our role in society as a financial institution.’\n\nAnalytics community\n\n‘Another aspect that makes my work so valuable, is the team. We all have a different background in education, culture and age, but we also have a lot in common. What I love is that we challenge each other to stay on our toes. We are eager to learn, to teach and we encourage each other.’\n\n‘Because of our shared talents, interests, and our close collaboration, I feel like I’m part of an analytics community within Rabobank. This feeling is a big part of what keeps me motivated and interested. I’m from Lithuania originally, and my family lives over there. But my team over here is so much fun, I see them as my work family. A family of highly intelligent and kind people. ‘\n\n","createdAt":1701165033,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"9d4f41a73038","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working at the heart of the bank, making it future-proof with predictive models","image":{"_key":"5ac9e3ad56f0","_type":"image","alt":"Paule outside at cycling path in front of Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-4f3a0dfcfc8d617aa0907a3fd666d38b488b8100-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"0f4d5ce8-f931-45ea-bcc8-d2d0fc1789fa","title":"Working on the housing future of the Netherlands","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-on-the-housing-future-of-the-netherlands"},"intro":"Started as a trainee and now Tribe Lead of Housing.

That's where I really learned the banking business. After 8 years it was time to broaden my horizons and I switched to the retail branch that focuses on private clients. Now I am Tribe lead Housing and responsible for everything Rabobank does around housing. These days, that's much more than just providing mortgages.\"\n\n\"At Rabobank, we work in Tribes which are themselves made up of Areas. The Housing Tribe consists of 8 Areas. Our services are very broad: from orientation and advice to the arranging mortgages and the service and management thereafter. In the coming years, we will be working towards greater speed and digital convenience for our customers, without losing sight of human contact. You can have a conversation with our advisors both online and face-to-face.\n\nTribe Housing: more than a mortgage lender\n\n“We work hard within Tribe Housing, but we also pay close attention to each other. We have a very open culture. Once every two weeks, we get together to celebrate what's going well, but we also look at what's not going so smoothly. That's where you learn from and see how you can do things differently next time.\"\n\n\"The Tribe's mission is 'Living Sustainably and Financially Healthy Together.' We help our customers to keep their financial situation sound. For example, offering more insight into the status of their mortgage or online advice on sustainability. Our ambition is to be more than a mortgage lender.\"\n\nSolar panels and sustainable, affordable housing\n\n\"When talking about housing, a number of social transitions in the Netherlands are very relevant. For example, access to the housing market is a very current issue. But climate risks and making homes more sustainable are also subjects that we are concerned with. It is the combination of innovation and enterprise that makes this subject so interesting.\"\n\n“How can we help make homes more sustainable, for example? You can advise your customers on solar panels or insulation and how to do it, but we really take that a step further. As a cooperative bank, we want to make an active contribution to improving the housing market. To this end, we have set up a campaign in which we think along and contribute to a better housing future in all sorts of ways.\"\n\nThe financing, but also ensure, via a partner, that they are installed on the roof. It is a huge success: 30,000 customers have signed up so far.\"\n\nWe are working with a project developer to build 15,000 affordable rental homes together with BPO, our subsidiary and largest area developer in the Netherlands. We also have the ambition to build 12,000 SmartBuilds: sustainable, temporary rental homes. And because, as a cooperative, we are not looking for maximum profit, we can also guarantee an affordable rent. As far as I'm concerned, this goes further than what a bank would normally do. We really want to participate in solving the housing problem.\"\n\nDriven by social motivation\n\n\"I have always had a great affinity with the bank's cooperative mission. I would like to give meaning to being a banker in a socially responsible way. As far as I'm concerned, a good banker is a person of trust with whom you can discuss your financial possibilities and opportunities, but also concerns, in order to achieve your own ambitions.\"\n\n\"Having a sense of social issues is very important. Contributing to a financially healthy life or increasing sustainability is what motivates people to work here. Personally, I have that motivation as well. I was raised with the idea that together we can make the world a little better and that it is good to take care of each other.

But banks cannot require this of their customers. After all, cash is legal tender. How do the analysts at Financial Economic Crime (FEC) verify that cash flows are legitimate?","content":"\"When the bank's detection system finds an anomaly in a transaction, I follow the flow of funds and investigate what's going on,\" says FEC analyst Marianne. \"We need to know who our customers are to keep the financial system safe.\"\n\nVacation or is something up?\n\n\"The WvFt (Dutch Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Act) is one big gray area: transactions are never right or wrong immediately. Suppose I'm looking at a company that conducts transactions abroad. For example, when a company imports carpets, it makes perfect sense for money to flow to that country. But if that same cash flow is coming from a baker, more research is needed. We must be able to establish a link between a money flow and the company. In a case like that, we would contact the customer, or request documents.\"\n\n\"You get to know what the norm is in a particular industry. I've been doing this work for over seven years now, so for me the gray area is a bit clearer. I completed an extensive training program for that. We are really on top of it: 99% of our customers are not doing anything wrong. It’s that 1% we have to find, but never at the expense of the other 99%. In the case of the baker, he might have just been on vacation for a week, and nothing was really wrong.\"\n\nFinding out who the customer is\n\nPart of FEC’s work stems from the Risk Detection Key. This sophisticated software detects different types of risks among customers. \"I look at what triggers the system and decide I think about that as a human being. I first look at what we know about this client in our system. Because what I already know, I don't have to ask about later. Sometimes I already know so much about a client that I can close a case without further contact, by checking public sources for example. If I don’t know much, I contact the client. I enter into these conversations very openly. I ask them to tell me something about their business. In most cases, I get an enthusiastic SME or self-employed person on the line who tells me all about their business.\"\n\n\n\nMarianne's team works on cases of varying complexity, from limited assessments to comprehensive investigations for high-risk clients. \"As you become more experienced as an analyst, you deal with more complicated cases. You look at complex risks and corporate structures.\" For cases with a high degree of sanctions risk, Marianne works with colleagues who have a different area of expertise, such as Sanctions.\" Sanctions law is very specialized, which is why we write the reports for these cases together.\"\n\nGrow personally and as a team\n\n\"We help each other grow. As you handle a greater variety of cases, your motivation becomes stronger. Why do I see a higher risk, or why don’t I? It's not just ticking boxes, you have to support your decisions well with arguments and the case has to be transparent. If someone else picks it up, they should come to the same conclusions.\"\n\n“There’s a good atmosphere in my team. We know where to find each other when we have questions. We give each other feedback about what is going well and what is not going well. If a client conversation did not go well, for example, you can listen to the recording with your team leader and discuss ways and tools that will help you have better conversations with clients.\"\n\n\n\nWithin FEC, you can advance to team lead, or go on work in one of the other departments and develop different areas of expertise. \"You can really go anywhere from FEC. And if you're not sure, you can even take a look around first. One of my colleagues has been seconded from our team to wholesale customer consulting for a while, just to see if that's what she wants.\"\n\n\nCommited to inclusion\n\n\"I am committed to diversity and inclusion both inside and outside Rabobank. I am a wheelchair user, for me accessibility is an important issue. Fortunately, this is generally good in Rabobank's offices. If you do encounter a problem in one of the buildings, the branch's facilities department will solve it. If you need adjustments in software or other supports, there is even a department that can help you figure it out and propose solutions.\"\n\n\"When I moved to a new location, right away my new team leader asked me to do a tour of the building with them to look for areas that needed improvement. I think that’s very special—Rabobank thinks in solutions, not obstacles. That is also my tip for people with a disability who see an interesting vacancy. Just respond, even if you think you can't tick all the boxes.\"\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1707914104,"updatedAt":1707916839,"representation":{"_key":"ad2c37674cf6","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Marianne","asset":{"_ref":"image-86a9cfb4a68d6f18de6a56be39fc395ae4514fef-4118x2746-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"How an FEC Analyst uncovers the real story behind money flows"},"skills":["change-agility","coaching","critical-thinking","customer-focused","decision-making","due-diligence","problem-solving","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"4f8933b4-4e88-4d0c-b92a-c49f8af90db0","title":"Architecture belongs to the entire organization","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"architecture-belongs-to-the-entire-organization"},"intro":"“We design the organization.” Business Architect Xander van Rooijen makes no bones about it. “As architects, we look at the needs of the business within Rabobank. What applications and services do they need to do their jobs well? You direct the design of those processes and that’s how you help the organization move forward.”","content":"Xander explains further: “Ever heard of Conway’s Law? It states that what an organization designs will mirror the communication structures of that same organization. And that in turn affects the architecture. This is why I find the reverse variation of Conway’s Law fascinating. If you want the designed architecture to work, you have to align the organization accordingly. So we really help in shaping the organization.”\n\nHis position is Managing Business Architect at Rabobank. “But the focus of my work lies with my role as Tribe Architect Data & Analytics, where I am responsible for architecture development and assurance. In doing so, I contribute to the vision and strategy of the Data & Analytics Tribe at Rabobank.”\n\nData as a value proposition\n\nXander believes data is crucial for the bank: “In addition to being a bank, Rabobank is also a technology company, and data and analytics play a crucial role in this. You need the data to keep your IT organization running and improving its efficiency. And the analytics are there to help us develop ever better services and propositions for our clients and our own organization. That's why, to me, this is the area within the bank to which I'd like to contribute. The different value propositions make it varied and challenging!”\n\nXander explains how he sees the various data & analytics (D&A) value propositions within a bank. He recognizes 3 aspects in this regard:\n\nD&A as a tool: You can use data & analytics to support other parts of the bank, enabling them to develop new services. Among other things, the Tribe builds self-service platforms where colleagues can internally offer, edit and provide data to other departments. But colleagues can also create advanced analytics solutions, compile reports and create dashboards. We make this possible by using the latest cloud technologies and are constantly pushing the envelope.\n\nD&A as a business driver: Within the Tribe, we take ownership of generic data products that can be used in multiple ways within the organization. Take, for example, an analytics engine that was developed internally to label transactions. That feature is primarily designed to give our clients insight into their financial health, but we quickly saw greater potential. This functionality can, for example, play an excellent role in other use cases and be used as an accelerator. The Tribe thus helps the business develop new products and services.\n\nD&A as a business enabler: Using our platforms and generic building blocks, other departments independently create business-specific applications. We as a Tribe provide them support with our expertise. This can include complex analyses on our client journeys or the implementation of a specific solution serving KYC analysts.\n\nXander continues: “The added value is in the business enabler. With this, we make it possible to roll out data and analytics scalably across the entire organization.”\n\nThat value proposition doesn’t come out of thin air. “The raison d’être of our Tribe is summed up in the mission 'Tech and data for people and society'. With technology and data, we help our clients lead financially healthy lives by giving them insight into their spending habits through the Rabo app. We do that thanks to the data we have and the tools we can build with it.” He thinks for a moment and continues: “In a broader social context, we are developing applications to monitor Financial Economic Crime (FEC) even better. We can apply smarter techniques that allow us to detect fraud and track down money launderers faster. This is how we’re fulfilling our social mission as a bank. And all with the help of data and analytics. Doing your part to combat those issues, from technology to teams and processes; that’s absolutely what drives me in terms of content.”\n\nArchitecture for and by everyone\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there for Xander. As Managing Business Architect, he has HR responsibilities for a small team of Business Architects and collaborates with approximately 20 solution architects. He provides support, facilitates where needed and coaches his team members to get the best out of themselves. “Doing meaningful work for the bank, for society and for my team members. To me, that’s the most beautiful combination there is.”\n\nXander doesn’t believe in the role of architect as something that stands alone. “No, definitely not,” he says firmly. “Ultimately, the architecture belongs to the organization as a whole and everyone should be responsible for it. An organization must be mature enough to take ownership of the architecture, regardless of your role. Until that happens, it is absolutely necessary for you to have architects to support you in this. An architect can look at things more independently from multiple perspectives.”\n\nThat does require something of his people and the new talents he seeks. “That’s correct. It is the responsibility of us as architects to safeguard the interplay of clients, the organization and our colleagues. It means being able to clearly explain where you want to go with your architecture. How to get people to buy into your story. That makes your storytelling skills and persuasiveness very important.”\n\nArchitecture is more than just processes and IT\n\nXander talks often about the human aspects of his work. It’s no different in his search for new talent. “You have to look at more than just processes and IT. How can people develop and take each other to the next level? Is it the people who can fulfil our vision in a way that we cannot yet do ourselves? I think that’s important.”\n\n“When I talk with people, I always expressly look at how they present themselves and with what perspective they look at problems. Is it out of curiosity and forward-looking? And do they think in terms of patterns rather than strict solutions? Can you look at the potential of a line of thinking from an abstract level, rather than just saying whether one technology is better than another? Then I’m interested in you!”\n\nWork on complex issues, together\n\nXander spent many years in the Navy before transitioning to a career in banking. They seem like different worlds, but Xander certainly sees similarities. As he himself says: “Contributing to the collaborative resolution of complex issues is why I get out of bed in the morning. Because you really are doing it for a greater good. You are part of the chain.” He refers to his time in the Navy.\n\n“On a ship, every position is important. No matter what you do, you have an important role, at that time, in that place. That’s an important line of thought, if you understand. The same applies equally to my current role as an architect. I am a link in a much larger chain, in which we contribute together to a greater cause. So it’s important to work with people who can help with that as well, who can add something. That makes it really awesome. That you do it together. We all contribute to the chain of a healthy and safe financial climate.”\n\nRabobank's appeal is sensible to Xander. “We are an international player and active in many areas. It’s a large and complex organization so as an architect you can always find your own challenge. My mission is to take ownership of the architecture in the organization and have everyone adopt architectural thinking. I’m passionately dedicated to this every day.”\n\n","createdAt":1701265667,"updatedAt":1705055207,"representation":{"_key":"784a14fc7cd7","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Architecture belongs to the entire organization","image":{"_key":"209c8450f38d","_type":"image","alt":"Business Architect Xander van Rooijen within the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-831d926a5f7a21bf2482c55ddfd3b380c65eae4f-2159x1440-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"subvakgebied","id":"ff0ebc8e-554b-422f-b50a-7f1d4fff2795","title":"FEC Investigations","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fec-investigations"},"vakgebiedSlug":{"_type":"slug","current":"financial-economic-crime"},"intro":"FEC Investigations is a specialist team at Rabobank that provides expertise worldwide in the prevention and detection of financial and economic crime.

A triumph: that goal was already achieved in January 2024. As a partner of Refugee Talent Hub, a platform that connects refugees and employers, the bank takes diversity and the together-promise – in which everyone gets the same opportunities – very serious. Serdar Sahin is one of the fifty refugees who have been hired by Rabo. In this article he opens up about the extraordinary journey he made – all the while balancing between sadness and hope. \"The support of those around me always kept me going,\" he says.","content":"Five years ago, Serdar fled Turkey where he lived a happy life with his wife and three sons. Due to circumstances, he had to leave his home and hearth overnight. “For eighteen years, I had a successful career. But my life as I knew it no longer existed. Everything that I had built up, and all my friends and family – I had to leave everything behind.”\n\nFeelings of guilt\n\nThis was the start of a very difficult period. Serdar said goodbye to his wife and children and left for Greece. \"I had planned many things for my future, but becoming a refugee in Greece was not on that list,\" he says with a keen sense of understatement. \"Once I was there, I didn't know what to expect. Actually, I had no expectations at all and just let everything wash over me.\"\n\nA month later, he continued his journey to Schiphol Airport. \"The customs officers were very friendly. Within a few hours, we finished all the procedures and I was allowed to proceed to Ter Apel.\" After ten days of paperwork, his stay in Ter Apel was over and he was allowed to move to Delfzijl. After that, it took about a year and a half until his asylum in the Netherlands was completely arranged. In the meantime, he stayed at various shelters, among which Apeldoorn and Rijswijk. \"The staff at the shelters were always very nice. Despite everything, I was satisfied with my living conditions in those places.\"\n\nFalling and getting up again\n\nMissing his family was definitely the most difficult part, but there were other, smaller things that he struggled with, which he can luckily laugh about. “I couldn't ride a bike very well, but in a country with more bikes than people, that's not very convenient. When I stayed in Delfzijl, I started practicing a lot. That got me a lot of bruises and scrapes!”\n\nAnother thing he had to get used to: the landscape. \"Moving from the mountains to flat country with the highest point being 320 meters – that was pretty crazy. And I should probably just not talk about the weather... But the thing I struggled with most was the Dutch language. Learning a new language at 45 years old is not easy.\" Despite his struggle with that wildly foreign language, his command of it, by the way, is second to none. In just five years, he has managed to make himself well understood, and that is immensely impressive.\n\nBut for Serdar, learning new habits and adapting to another culture is a small feat compared to the moment he had to leave his native country. \"That's what I found most difficult,\" he says, looking back on it. \"To have to leave there and leave everything behind, I hope never to have to go through something like that again.\"\n\nNetworking, networking, networking\n\nOnce in the Netherlands, Serdar wanted to make himself useful as soon as possible. “Getting benefits didn't feel right to me. I wanted to work, to contribute something. In addition to the courses I took, I started looking for a job. I also looked for volunteer work. My language coach pointed me to some places where I could apply. Eventually, I was hired at De Voedselbank [a Dutch food bank organisation, ed.]. I worked there for about six months and I will never forget that place. Everyone was extremely kind, I felt right at home there.\"\n\nOnce his residence permit was complete, he started looking for a place of his own. He found it in The Hague. “My wife and children were still in Turkey. I did miss them, but I tried to focus on improving my Dutch. I started a program called “Transition Year Higher Education” at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. At first my application was rejected, because normally that program is not meant for 'old' people, but for students who want to go to university. I managed to convince the committee that it was my wish to learn as much Dutch as possible in a short period of time. That was accepted!”\n\nMeanwhile, he also continued to apply for a permanent job. Serdar: \"As a refugee, it is difficult when no one knows you. In the Netherlands, you often have the best chance when people hear of you via word of mouth. So I had to start networking. What I really like about the Netherlands are foundations. I applied to several foundations. One of them was Gast aan Tafel (t\u002Fn: “Guest at the table”). They pair you up with a Dutch family that helps you get used to the Netherlands. That's how I met Martine, a single mother of two children. She told me that she had once worked for NATO in northern Macedonia and, like me, in Kosovo. We got talking about our experiences and at one point I mentioned to her that I was looking for work. I found that difficult, I was ashamed of it, but I had to do something, because my unemployment was making me feel desperate. After all, I had worked ever since I was 20 years old, and now I was unable to. I went to school and volunteered, but also wanted to find a steady job. Martine asked me if I could send her my resume sometime. Of course I wanted to!\"\n\nEverything in Dutch, please\n\nIt turned out to be bull's-eye. Martine's brother-in-law knew someone at Rabobank and a while later she told Serdar that something might be possible there. \"She had passed on my details and I was called by Sander Aandeweg, team lead at FEC, Financial Economic Crime. We had a nice informal conversation and I was allowed to apply for a job. I was very excited.\" He did also feel a bit anxious, because in the meantime he had already sent out many 'cold' applications, without any success. “With those applications, I was always told that they had another candidate with more experience. Now I was finally allowed to come for an interview. I had one chance. It was now or never!”\n\nAs it was to be his first official job interview in Dutch, Serdar prepared himself to perfection. \"My later hiring manager, Stijn de Bruijn, was present at the interview and he asked if I preferred to speak in English. But since I had resolved to keep living and working here, I chose Dutch. I had to and would master that language.\" Serdar's tireless efforts were rewarded. He was hired and began a two-month training program as a KYC analyst in November 2021. \"The first month was very difficult,\" he says. “During the day, I took all the classes, but in the evening, I re-watched them. To make sure I had understood everything.”\n\nHe successfully completed the training program and was transferred to his current team in Rotterdam. Team leader Sjoerd Vooijs paired him with colleague Özlem. \"She is also Turkish, so we could help each other if there was a language problem. At least, that was the idea, but in practice we never spoke Turkish to each other. She did help me a lot with understanding all kinds of files and systems. I also got a lot of support from Sjoerd and my immediate colleagues. That team is really great.\"\n\nA second chance\n\nSerdar approves of Rabobank's policy. “I think it is great that the bank encourages diversity and actually has a department for it. I have also attended Rabo Kleurrijk (t\u002Fn: ”Rabo Colorful\") events already. And through colleagues I got a 'language buddy'. When I told Sjoerd one day that a friend of mine, also from a foreign background, was looking for a job and had asked if I could be a reference, he advised me to talk to Stijn about it. Through him and a colleague at HR, Gülsah Bas, I learned about the Refugee Talent Hub and the way Rabobank helps status holders. That friend later trained as a KYC analyst with a group of eleven new colleagues acquired through the Refugee Talent Hub and is now also working at the bank. As an employee, I am very proud that the bank gives everyone such equal opportunities, even if your background does not immediately fit a position.\"\n\nAfter a long period of sadness and uncertainty, life is luckily looking brighter again for Serdar. He has been reunited with his wife and children, has made new friends and gets along well with his colleagues. He is immensely grateful to everyone he has met on his journey and who has helped him. \"I work hard and always try to overcome problems,\" he says, \"but I have also had a lot of support from the people around me. That made it easier to get used to new situations.\" Whether he ever wants to return to Turkey? At least not in in the foreseeable future. \"The Netherlands gave me a second chance and now I want to make the most of it here. For myself, my family and society.\"\n\n","createdAt":1714040630,"updatedAt":1714124775,"representation":{"_key":"5c5a79ce0ac7","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"On the run: Serdar on his second life in the Netherlands and at Rabobank","image":{"_key":"4256399ba124","_type":"image","alt":"Man poseert op de trap voor een Rabobankkantoor","asset":{"_ref":"image-167816df6843226c8066e4be2e169a0a6cf2f64b-3024x4032-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0.2218934911242605,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0.2875739441820857},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.4905325646936538,"width":1,"x":0.5,"y":0.5328402265289126}}},"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"b0fe0734-477f-43af-a709-865f816e9b74","title":"Your own energy-neutral home and promoting sustainable newbuild at national level","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"your-own-energy-neutral-home-and-promoting-sustainable-newbuild-at-national-level"},"intro":"Helping your local community become more sustainable while building a home which generates as much energy as it uses. And simultaneously working to promote sustainable newbuild projects. That’s how Ellen Posthoorn, content marketeer Housing, works on her development and shapes the world around her.","content":"Ellen works for Rabobank at the Housing Marketing Department, where she supports the “Newbuild projects” group. “The combination of newbuild and sustainable building is fascinating. I provide information on the financing options – such as our green mortgage products – to the project developers and the potential buyers of the newbuild homes.”\n\nEllen is no stranger to sustainable housing. She and her family built one of the first completely energy-neutral homes in the West-Brabant region, known in Dutch as NulopdeMeter (NLM) housing. “To qualify as NLM, our house must be able to use the same amount of energy as it generates independently, measured over the period of one year. We generate energy through a heat pump and solar panels. We keep our energy consumption low through effective insulation and energy saving measures. This way we can reduce our energy bill to zero.”\n\nLiving sustainably through Rabobank?\n\n“Our ambition is to be the most sustainable bank for housing in the Netherlands. I am really keen to help solve this societal challenge. The energy transition is simply too important, not only for society as a whole but also for my little boy’s future!\" Ellen’s determination shines through both in her work as a content marketeer and as a Rabobank ambassador in her local community.\n\nShe gives her all to every project that comes her way. When she saw an appeal on intranet for staff to tell their local communities about Rabobank, she registered straightaway. “It involves anything from teaching a class in school, giving a presentation, or presenting a Rabo Clubsupport check to a local sports club. It gives me great pleasure to help so many people and makes me proud to work for Rabobank too.”\n\nEnergy cooperative\n\nEllen is also involved with a local energy cooperative project called Opgewekt Drimmelen. “I saw that a new energy cooperative was starting up near my home. The cooperative installs solar panels on the roofs of large farms and supplies the electricity generated to local residents.”\n\nThe people running the cooperative were looking for help to raise awareness of the project and asked the Director of the local Rabobank for help, who in turn asked Ellen. She and two co-workers volunteered to write the communications plan. “I did that partly in my own time and partly during working hours. Rabobank gives me time and space to support sustainable projects and I can the knowledge and experience I gained from the organization to play my part.”\n\nAfter helping the project get off to a successful start Ellen and Rabobank reduced their involvement but they still receive updates. “The cooperative now supplies 270 households with locally generated green energy. This is a great example of a local project that I can get really enthusiastic about!\"\n\nShowcasing sustainability\n\nEllen also comes across local projects in her job in the Rabobank Housing Marketing team. There are 16 people in the team, Ellen explains: “we each have our own focus area. Mine is the newbuild market.”\n\nOne of her tasks is to help project developers produce and publish customer stories relating to sustainable housing. “We give the project developers tips, content, resources and blogs. We showcase their sustainable projects to create interest among possible buyers.”\n\n“A good example is Klein Gouda, which is a new residential area on the south-west side of the city. The industrial building styles are inspired by Gouda’s historic streets and canals. We work with the project developers to encourage builders and architects to design and build new homes in line with the criteria for a government-issued ‘green certificate’. The criteria can vary from the type of timber used to the color of the solar panels, and the expected energy performance. The Klein Gouda project was given a green certificate and nearly every house has been sold. “It was a great success for all concerned.”\n\nCustomized approach\n\nEllen is enthusiastic about the bank’s local and cooperative mentality. “You need to start locally and then scale up. You need to customize your approach to each municipality. That’s where Rabobank’s rootedness in local communities is a real advantage because we know the people and the area. The commitment to society and the help we offer really energizes me.” On the other hand, Ellen sometimes finds it hard to ask for help herself. With a smile, she says, “I have to admit, as the daughter of entrepreneurs, I have a very strong sense of responsibility for my work. Sometimes I need to just let things go.”\n\n“Our team recently took part in a session that helped us better understand our talents and motives. Since then, my co-workers keep reminding me that I don’t need to do everything myself and that they’re happy to help. That’s a personal learning path which is helping me to develop.” \n\nCollaboration and stakeholder management are key competences in the marketing teams. “Sometimes it’s hard to know who the right person is to answer a particular question. Because I know a lot about the local banks and the different systems, I’m happy to point new colleagues in the right direction. You’re never on your own here. We all have the cooperative mindset and way of working in our DNA.”\n\n","createdAt":1701870029,"updatedAt":1703004662,"representation":{"_key":"5362b8d40785","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"title":"Your own energy-neutral home","label":"article","image":{"_key":"c78d12ded96f","_type":"image","alt":"Ellen Posthoorn with construction helmet in front of new construction homes and crane.","asset":{"_ref":"image-ff3b435ed0925baf6a8644719009726de2110eab-3200x2133-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-analysis","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","policy-implementation","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["transitions"],"vakgebied":"customer-product","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"1e00163d-506a-4ad3-8c86-d407c0194604","title":"From Belgrado to Utrecht: The story of Product Owner Milan","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"from-belgrado-to-utrecht-the-story-of-product-owner-milan"},"intro":"Milan is a Product Owner (Global Transaction Monitoring) at Rabobank. He embarked on a remarkable journey, both in his life and career, to eventually join FEC Tech; the department that combats financial crime with data and analytics. “In a field where so much excitement happens, the art is in maintaining calmness and a bird’s eye view overview.”","content":"Milan grew up in former Yugoslavia. After his Engineering studies at the University of Belgrade, he decided to gain international experience. He joined AIESEC International (the world’s largest student organization focused on leadership development and international exchange) and interned as a Business Analyst at Alcatel-Lucent in Paris.\n\n\nClose to the Heart\n\nIn the city of love, Milan not only found an internship, but also met his wife. Both got a great opportunity in their careers. He at a bank, she at a multinational company. After living in Belgium for a few years, they decided to move to the Netherlands together. “After working for 14 years at another Dutch bank, I was approached by an intermediary who was looking for people with experience in data management on behalf of Rabobank. I had gained that experience by then and realized that the gatekeeper role that FEC fulfills would be closer to my heart.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction Monitoring\n\nFor the past 9 months, Milan has been fulfilling the role of Product Owner within FEC Tech. “My teams and I are involved in transaction monitoring. Specifically, we build rules for the application that our FEC colleagues use to monitor transactions. We are currently using an external application, but we would rather use a platform that we have already developed internally. This means we are no longer dependent on an external application and it gives us one uniform source of truth.”\n\n\n\nProduct Owner within FEC Tech\n\nAs a Product Owner, Milan is a hub in the web. “I constantly receive conditions from various business and IT stakeholders. My task is to prioritize these, considering the limited capacity and timelines. This way, the most important matters are addressed and delivered on time.”\n\nMilan experiences a lot of autonomy within his role, but also, taking initiative is important. “I see myself as a kind of small entrepreneur at Rabobank, who collaborates with other entrepreneurs. The freedom you get here is nice, provided you are assertive and initiative rich. Everyone is enthusiastic, but you have to approach people yourself. Fortunately, people like to work together.”\n\n\nInternational Organization\n\nMilan has lived in many different places, speaks five languages, and has moved from his homeland to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. He seems to feel at home everywhere, but certainly at Rabobank. “Rabobank is a Dutch bank, but it is very international. I work here with many people who - like me - come from another country. No matter where you come from, you are welcome here. What matters is who you are and the knowledge and expertise you bring.”\n\n\n","createdAt":1711722839,"updatedAt":1711723860,"representation":{"_key":"8d5bba1f609e","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Milan","asset":{"_ref":"image-ef0c7110f7641bdf5aec5765c008cc2a9b03fa27-6937x4625-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.9923658977095674,"width":0.353702910958904,"x":0.4577651350465538,"y":0.5038170511452162}},"label":"article","title":"From Belgrado to Utrecht: The story of Product Owner Milan"},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","project-coordination","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","inclusiveness"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"0059ced7-f53d-4e0b-a344-166bf62b827d","title":"Wavemakers: A journey towards sustainable IT ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"wavemakers-sustainable-it-at-rabobank"},"intro":"After realizing the significant impact IT has on global emissions, Tech Lead Renske Melchers decided to use her IT expertise and passion for sustainability to make a change. One small step at a time, Wavemakers is working towards a future where sustainability is seamlessly integrated into every aspect of IT within Rabobank. What future does Renske see for Wavemakers and its impact on Rabobank?","content":"When asked how it all began, Renske talks about how the clear skies during the pandemic really opened her eyes. “I first came across the topic of sustainability during my academic studies, but its impact became particularly clear to me during the pandemic. With fewer cars on the roads and planes in the air, the skies looked so clean and blue. That had a profound effect on me.”\n\n“I then realized that my work in IT also has a large impact on sustainability. Research shows that IT is currently responsible for 3.5-4% of total global carbon emissions, which is more than global aviation. Through Wavemakers we aim to change this.”\n\nWorking together to implement sustainability in IT\n\nWavemakers at Rabobank is a project focused on integrating sustainability into the bank's IT operations. Renske: “Since we launched Wavemakers last year, I've become increasingly aware of the significant impact IT has on our environment. Wavemakers aims to integrate sustainability in everything we do in a meaningful and fun way. We organize training and workshops for developers, scrum masters and product owners with a focus on sustainability. Through education, tools and internal support, we’re working towards reducing the carbon footprint of IT operations within Rabobank.”\n\n“There is so much we can do; even on a personal level, you can make a difference. For example, by extending the lifespan of your devices. The amount of materials, water, and fossil fuels used in producing them is enormous. Using a laptop or phone just one year longer can make a huge difference.”\n\nWorking smarter saves energy\n\nAn interesting way for IT teams to save energy is by demand shifting. This means switching off servers and environments wherever possible and scheduling workloads and computing tasks to run at times when green energy is abundant and cheaper.\n\n“We encourage our developers to think about how they implement software features, particularly in terms of reducing processing power. For example, by disabling test environments on the weekend. Even small adjustments for running processes or pipelines can make a significant impact. Our goal is to increase awareness of these opportunities among our development teams.”\n\n“We need to demonstrate that our adjustments truly make a difference. To achieve this, we ‘ve developed the Carbon Insights Tool, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the CO2 emissions associated with specific features developed by a team. From the bottom up, we can help teams understand the impact of their work.”\n\nSupport from across the bank\n\nThe project focuses on creating a culture of environmental responsibility within the organization. Renske: “Getting employees from different departments involved helps everyone adopt sustainable practices and builds a sense of shared responsibility. We get a lot of freedom and support from management to get involved in sustainability. This really helps us move forward. We are still in the awareness phase, but the blinkers are coming off and people are really getting to see the impact of their actions.”\n\nFrom waves to still waters: transforming IT at Rabobank\n\nIntegrating sustainability into a large organization like Rabobank is no small feat. As Renske points out, “We’re not there yet, but we’re making waves. My personal view as an IT professional is we just have to do this. I believe that every little bit helps, and actions adds up. In my view, if every company in the Netherlands takes similar steps, we can all benefit. I truly believe that with the help of all Rabobank employees, we can make a significant difference.”\n\nLooking ahead, she envisions a future where Wavemakers becomes an integral part of Rabobank's operations, eventually making the initiative itself redundant. “Hopefully, in five years' time, Wavemakers will no longer be needed. Then we just have still waters, instead of waves,” she says, underscoring the ultimate goal of fully integrating sustainability into the company’s culture.\n\nThe enthusiasm and dedication of the Wavemakers team are inspiring. The initiative has sparked a movement within Rabobank, with employees across various departments eager to contribute. “People get so incredibly excited about the subject,” Renske shares, “and that just makes me super proud to be part of this.”\n\nSources\n\nBordage, F.

Never losing sight of the goal: helping smallholder farmers in Latin America Africa and Asia earn a decent living by providing additional income streams. That’s how Maarten Rijnberg, Marketing Lead at Acorn, works to improve himself and the world around him.","content":"Maarten loves to take risks, calculated risks that is. He trusts his own intuition and expertise and stays calm when things don’t go as planned. One of his passions is surfing the waves. When the swell’s right, you’ll find him on a board on the North Sea, not at his desk at home. Once he’s cleared his head and enjoyed what nature has to offer, he goes back to work energized and ready to help smallholder farmers generate extra income. “As a start-up we move fast. But I can always make time and space to charge my battery. If you’re looking for a good work-life balance, Rabobank’s got that sorted.”\n\nA start-up at a bank?\n\n“Yes, that’s not what you’d expect, but it’s certainly possible,” Maarten explains. “I’d been working at Rabobank for a while as a finance specialist, then I moved on to several roles in the bank’s marketing department. I got talking to Jelmer van de Mortel, Head of Acorn at Rabobank. I’d never heard of Acorn, so he told me all about it.” Acorn is a program to help smallholder farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America transition to more sustainable agroforestry while at the same time sequestering carbon.\n\nMaarten took the leap and applied for a vacancy as innovation manager. Next thing he knew he was in a new job in a different department at Rabobank, working to set up a technological trading platform in the rapidly growing carbon credits market. “Whiteboard sessions, creative sessions, testing pilot projects … There were tons of ideas going in all kinds of directions. The first thing we did was to streamline them.”\n\nLike many start-ups, at a certain point Acorn chose to pivot. They now focus entirely on scaling up the number of projects with the farmers and increasing the number of Carbon Removal Units generated. Given his background as a marketeer, Maarten’s new challenge was to shape this new focus. “What a boost that was. We built the website and infrastructure ourselves from scratch, we created the brand story, ran campaigns to create awareness in the market, and built a high-quality customer base. We do everything in-house with our own team.”\n\nFor Maarten, this is typical of how you can operate as an innovative enterprise within Rabobank. “A large corporate is highly structured and regulated, which is necessary of course. But all those processes can slow things down.” That’s not such a problem at Acorn, says Maarten, because they test the limits of the system to stay fast and flexible. “Acorn gave me a lot of ownership in the projects. Having that responsibility really supports my personal development. I’d never realized how many opportunities there were until I looked at my work this way. We’re free to follow our own path and at the same time we have an amazing impact on people’s lives.”\n\nThe positive impact of agroforestry\n\nSmallholder farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America are some of the hardest-hit by climate change. Volatility in global food prices, drought, soil degradation, and failed harvests all mean lower yields, which directly affect the livelihoods of families and local communities. Acorn helps these farmers through agroforestry. This involves planting fruit and nut-bearing trees (such as mango or cashews) between rows of regular agricultural crops.\n\nAgroforestry has three positive impacts:\n\nthe trees capture CO₂ from the air which helps reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere,\n\nthe trees provide an extra source of income and food for people and animals in the region,\n\nthe local ecosystem improves thanks to greater diversity of trees and crops.\n\nFarmers receive additional income from the fruit and nut harvests and from the sequestered carbon dioxide which Acorn sells in the form of Carbon Removal Units (CRU) to responsible companies who want to compensate their emissions.\n\nMaarten: “We’re helping over 200,000 smallholder farmers across the world who have committed to Acorn. They receive 80% of the revenue generated by the CRUs. We keep a Rabobank Carbon Registry for complete transparency. For every carbon removal unit you buy, you can check our website to see exactly which farmer and which piece of land it relates to.” Acorn has already paid the farmers EUR 4.5 million and is aiming high. “We want to scale up and work with millions of farmers.”\n\nMaarten is clear about the reasons for putting his energy and expertise into this project: “We don’t want to go back to how things were. There is no going back. We must move to a new reality with more sustainable agriculture and sustainable agroforestry. We have to help to bring about a system change. Acorn gives me the opportunity to make my contribution.”\n\nKeeping up the pace\n\nIn two years Acorn has grown from 10 to almost 60 employees, ranging from account managers to data scientists and geo-specialists. The models and technologies to remotely measure CO₂ were developed in-house. The same goes for the technology to read out all the data from the satellite images. The registry of projects and all communication tasks relating to Acorn take place physically within Rabobank, where Acorn has a designated space. How do they keep up the pace in their projects?\n\nMaarten believes it’s a great combination of the mindset of a start-up and the facilities Rabobank offers. “It’s fantastic to work with Rabobank departments such as Legal, Risk, and Corporate Communications. Especially when it comes to sensitive issues like communication, new pilot projects, or privacy issues. But we work at a different speed to the bank. We move fast. And we want to move even faster. We’re always quick to try something new, always with the same objective: to help smallholder farmers in Latin America, Asia, and Africa achieve a system change and a decent income, and while reducing the impact on the climate.”\n\n","createdAt":1701875790,"updatedAt":1707731292,"representation":{"_key":"4199d1c9551a","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Organize your own schedule and reduce CO₂ emissions","image":{"_key":"d5764d27676b","_type":"image","alt":"Maarten Rijnberg, Marketing Lead at Acorn, walking in the forrest.","asset":{"_ref":"image-b141400626fa6c8e627eef86251833005f4769cc-2560x1706-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-analysis","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","policy-implementation","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["transitions"],"vakgebied":"digital-innovation","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"2d77f569-bbf5-455a-9dcb-266213a1c385","title":"Sustainability and detection rules: Business Analist (FEC Tech) Eloy","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sustainability-and-detection-rules-business-analist-fec-tech-eloy"},"intro":"Eloy, FEC Tech Business Analyst, studied mechanical engineering and completed a master in Systems & Control. He wrote his graduation thesis on self-driving cars, but he passed by the turnoff to the automotive industry. He preferred to use his talent to make a social impact. He chose a career at Rabobank.","content":"“During my master’s, I already learned more about programming and the abstract, mathematical side. I noticed how much I enjoyed the aspect of controlling systems. I wanted to put that into practice.” Eloy was part of the start of FEC Tech and has experienced the growth of the field from the beginning. “We started with a handful of people and had to figure everything out. Because of that, it sometimes felt like I was working at a startup.”\n\n\nWholesale & Rural\n\nIn the meantime, the FEC team has grown and split into sub-teams. Within Transaction Monitoring (TM), Eloy, along with 10 others, is part of the Wholesale & Rural team. “The international part of AML Transaction Monitoring”, where Eloy and colleagues focus on transactions of large corporate customers in Brazil and London. How does that work? Eloy: “Every day, files come in on our servers that contain information about customers and transactions. This data is processed by scripts that check for correct data and with that data we build customer profiles. These profiles give us insight into what normal behavior is for a certain type of customer. With individual customers, like you and me, we mainly see pin transactions and the like. With companies, we see a lot of transactions with other companies.”\n\n\n\n\nDetection Rules\n\nAs FEC Tech Business Analyst, Eloy now has a coordinating and advisory role. “Yet I still enjoy solving technical issues and coming up with creative solutions. I am now mainly involved in more complex tasks, such as developing new detection rules. This includes, for example: identifying relevant risks and creating pseudocode for functional detection.”\n\nThe detection rules that Eloy talks about are not just applicable anywhere. “Each industry has its own set of rules that produce alerts. These alerts include a piece of code that points to potentially suspicious behavior of the customer. So, if there is an unusual activity or there is a strange party involved, we ensure that it is further investigated.”\n\n\n\nMaking an Impact\n\nIn addition to the impact that Eloy makes as FEC Tech Business Analyst, he contributes to society in another way. “I find sustainability very important and interesting. That’s why I started a Young Professional Program at Global Compact, a spin-off organization of the UN. Global Compact focuses on achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.”\n\n\n\n“Together with professionals from other companies, I am following a program at Global Compact for a year. We meet each other every two weeks, digitally or on location, with each participant alternating as host.” Soon it will be Eloy’s turn. “I’m going to speak, but I will also invite colleagues to do so. For example, at the Lead Road to Paris event, a team member talked about Transaction Monitoring and another colleague spoke about intuitive leadership.”\n\nThe culture at FEC tech\n\nEloy speaks openly about the good atmosphere at FEC Tech. “We have a very young, close-knit team, that also sees eachother outside of work hours. We sometimes play Dungeons & Dragons, there is a game night every quarter, and we regularly eat pizza together.” So, a team full of enthusiasts. “There are just a lot of young people who are excited! The good atmosphere, the technical aspect, and the fact that you can contribute to society, makes me recommend this work to everyone.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711454922,"updatedAt":1714124226,"representation":{"_key":"15416bd3f214","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Eloy","asset":{"_ref":"image-f08308d8d6a1532856b12b86bd0e0d65994afdbd-6494x4329-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.9559215646243415,"width":0.5610727806613872,"x":0.5,"y":0.5}},"label":"article","title":"Sustainability and detection rules: Business Analist (FEC Tech) Eloy"},"skills":["business-analysis","business-networking","business-process-improvements","data-insights","requirements-analysis","solution-architecture"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"6e686017-c6c5-49b4-8971-8224a2e0e484","title":"The Red Team: the ethical hackers of Rabobank","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"rabobanks-red-team"},"intro":"Rabobank is protecting itself against hackers and cybercriminals. Hundreds of cyber employees are joining forces to stay as far ahead of cybercriminals as possible. Systems are getting better and better and IT specialists are getting smarter, but does the same apply to the other side. Cybersecurity is no longer a future topic. Now it's the time.","content":"More about The Red Team\n\nOne of the teams working on cybersecurity is the odd one out. Rabobank's Red Team is a team of ethical hackers that tries to attack the bank in all sorts of ways, with the goal of actually protecting it. From actively hacking its own systems, to an \"innocent\" phishing email to Rabobank colleagues; the Red Team tries to discover weaknesses in security, so they can then strengthen them.\n\nWho are these people? How do they operate, and where lies the ethical boundary? You will hear from ethical hackers Luc Kolen, Neal de Vocht and their team lead Kelvin Rorive himself in this three-part podcast (Dutch only).\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nWidespread digitization\nThe Netherlands is one of the most digitized countries, thanks to education, entrepreneurs and government. Ever larger parts of society are moving into the digital domain. And the more digital the society, the more likely cybercrime will occur.\n\nCybercriminals are getting smarter\nCybercriminals possess specialized knowledge. They are getting smarter and smarter, trying to hack systems and organizations through phishing, ransomware and DDoS attacks. The chance of an organization being hit by a cyber attack is currently 1 in 5.\n\nThe impact is significant\nDoes a hacker manage to get in? Then that could mean private data is out in the open, systems are locked down and people can't do their jobs.\n\nThe Red Team as the ultimate test\n\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, a bank has a duty of care to make customers and business owners aware of the risks and to make sure they can bank safely. In doing so, you can never rule out a cyber attack completely, but you can reduce the chance as much as possible. But you don't know if something is really secure until you attack it. That's what makes the work of the Red Team so important. They are the ultimate cybersecurity test.","createdAt":1701261331,"updatedAt":1703058309,"representation":{"_key":"630a190eccfe","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"The Red Team: the ethical hackers of Rabobank","image":{"_key":"77ff1f2daddd","_type":"image","alt":"Luc en Neal sitting on the stairs in the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-abb0b3635465a888762d74b8a78a72d4ad8ad2bf-2200x1404-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["change-agility","cloud-computing","customer-focused","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","distributed-systems","information-technology-security","information-technology-strategies","problem-management","solution-architecture","technology-landscape"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"259a8e4d-18fd-4af6-bcd2-5ddf0695988b","title":"Working with a disability: “Go on that adventure together”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-with-a-disability"},"intro":"In late 2020, Rabobank employee Jurgen van Haperen was diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, which was partly why he decided to find a job that suited him better. He ended up in Financial Economic Crime. “I can work independently here and my colleagues are understanding of my situation.” He hopes his story will inspire other people with disabilities.","content":"Jurgen doesn’t beat around the bush: “I would like to tell my colleagues that they should always believe in themselves. That’s my most important message. If you know what you’re capable of and believe in yourself, it will all work out in the end. You just have to keep going.” He speaks from experience. When he ran into a career dip, he refused to give up and proved his mettle instead.\n\nHe joined Rabobank in September 2006, holding different reporting positions at Wholesale & Rural for 12 years. In 2018 he moved over to data. Jurgen: “The data role demanded a lot from my communication skills,” he said. “It became clear that conveying the message was not my strong suit. It was hard to hear, but I also knew that my knowledge and skills were strong. I knew what the job was about and I had proven it over several years.”\n\nReintegration track\n\nIn autumn 2019, Jurgen noticed that his job was costing him too much energy. He reached out to the company doctor. Jurgen: “I’d had a hard time recharging my battery after a really busy period at work, so I asked for help. In consultation with the company doctor, I took a step back and my general practitioner pointed me towards a program that would help reveal the cause. I started working again, but I worked fewer hours.”\n\nIn November 2020, he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. He can function perfectly well with this developmental disability, but he does need more time for some things. On the other hand, his “challenge,” as he calls it, works to his advantage. “I can do certain tasks exceptionally fast.” He continued, “Give me a complicated Excel sheet with a lot of data and I’ll have it figured out in half an hour.\"\n\nJurgen discovered what was a good fit for him and what made him happy. “I ended up applying for an in-house position at Financial Economic Crime (FEC). The interview started well, but ended on a low note when I was asked an unexpected question. Something like that throws me off guard, and I can get stuck if I haven’t had time to prepare. I tried to come up with an answer, but I couldn’t. Unfortunately, getting stuck that way was enough to bring an end to the application process.”\n\nBut Jurgen didn’t give up. “I knew that my strong analytical skills meant I’d be right at home at FEC. I shouldn’t be written off because of a single snapshot, right?” He got in touch with different people within Rabobank and quickly established a good network. That was fruitful: “In February 2021 I spoke to somebody in HR. I explained my situation, emphasising that I couldn’t imagine that no-one in FEC would want to give me a chance. She agreed with me and not long after, I was sitting down with the location manager in Amsterdam and my future team leader. The meeting went well right from the start. We agreed that I would complete a two-month in-house course and then join FEC as an analyst.” And so it went. In fall 2021, Jurgen began a new chapter in his career at Rabobank in Zaandam.\n\nPerseverance\n\nIt was a good chapter, but one that ended in late 2023. “I’m a person who has a challenge, and I don’t hide it. I noticed that management expected more from FEC analysts than I had to offer and realized that the position wasn’t 100% for me. So I had a look at other internal roles and found a model tester position at FEC. The role was more structured and that’s something I need. I got the job, af first on secondment, and could stay on if I still liked it after three months. There’s no doubt in my mind though, I am really excited about this new opportunity and I know I can do it.”\n\nIgnorance\n\nJurgen sees that Rabobank is making good strides when it comes to inclusiveness. But not everyone is “up to date\" yet. \"I notice that the opportunities I get often depend on who I meet within the bank. That’s because there is still a lot of ignorance about autism. So it’s important to be open about your additional challenges. Being transparent and honest with those around you about what your challenges are works to your advantage. Because you know better where your strengths and weaknesses lie, you don't have to hide your challenges and other people can help you brainstorm about the which roles would suit you best.”\n\nJurgen also wants to support team leaders and managers with tips like: dare to think out of the box. \"Choose people with communication skills, but also people with analytical skills. Don’t go looking for unicorns, because they don't exist. For example, I know that I am very meticulous, down to the smallest details. Dare to choose different qualities for a team. Give people space but go on that adventure together.\"","createdAt":1712058790,"updatedAt":1712059488,"representation":{"_key":"eb2e05f9455b","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working with a disability: “Go on that adventure together”","image":{"_key":"aa0df655e59c","_type":"image","alt":"Man sits on the couch and looks into the camera","asset":{"_ref":"image-d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"3cc07666-1265-41e3-8f9c-07b4480f32ef","title":"Network ‘Rabo Colourful’ aims for more cultural diversity","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"network-colorful-rabo-aims-for-more-cultural-diversity"},"intro":"Rabo Colorful is the internal network for and by employees with a bi-cultural background. Board members Edselline Jozephia (Manager Insurances) and Souad el Kholte (Team Lead Business Clients CDD) tell us the importance of cultural diversity, about Keti Koti and Ramadan and how they work on more connection and awareness.","content":"What is Rabo Colorful?\n\n“Rabo Colorful is the diversity network within Rabobank Netherlands where colleagues from culturally diverse backgrounds are strengthened in terms of work and personal development. We strive for positive awareness of cultural diversity. We share experiences, give each other tips, support each other and organize events. We are the face of a colorful organization and provide guidance on cultural diversity topics within Rabobank”, tells Edselline.\n\n“In 2020, during the Black Lives Matter-protests, I felt a strong need to commit myself to creating more awareness of discrimination, prejudice, and racism. With my team I already recorded a video about this. I looked for like-minded people within the bank with whom I could talk about these things. That’s how I discovered Rabo Colorful and eventually, I joined the board. Now I can work on awareness much more broadly, outside my own team.”\n\n“I believe that as Rabobank we should reflect society”, says Souad. “Our customers are also very diverse. With more cultural diversity in the office, you will get more varied perspectives. Diversity is now also an important theme within the organization. For example, HR has a strategy for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with clear, measurable goals. As Rabo Colorful we actively commit to this.”\n\nRabo Colorful has over 275 members and a renewed board since the end of 2022, which now consists of 7 board members: Edselline Jozephia, Odessa Tseng, Diejana van der Wal (chair), Souad el Kholte, Anne-Marie Breuker, Nourelhouda Kassi and Patrick Sanwikarja (in the photo from left to right).\n\n\n\nKeti Koti and Ramadan\n\nAwareness, Commitment, and Empowerment: these are the main priorities of Rabo Colorful. Edselline explains: “We organize different events. Last year, for our 5-year anniversary, we organized an event together with RaboWomen, another diversity network. We invited Marian Spier, who has written the book Impact, about personal and business leadership. Together with her, we looked ahead: what else can we do to make Rabobank more colorful?”\n\nSouad: “And this past spring we organized our ‘Colorful Dinner' – an iftar with about 100 employees. An iftar is the breaking of the fast during Ramadan, the meal after sunset. Also here we had an inspiring speaker and meaningful conversations at the dinner table. Ramadan is so much more than only fasting. These kinds of events work really well to bring people together and raise awareness.”\n\nEdselline: “This year we especially want to focus on Keti Koti, on July 1st. On that day, it is 150 years ago that the Netherlands abolished slavery. A day to commemorate, but also to celebrate. Keti Koti is not only a meaningful day for the people in our community, but for all of the Netherlands. What is nice is that members from our community approached us with ideas for an event. We embraced that and together with them, we will organize a Keti Koti-event, this fall. On the one hand, we want to increase awareness on our history and how it still affects people today. A lot of people don’t know what Keti Koti means. On the other hand, again, we want to bring people from the bank together. And also here, food connects us. So we will invite a chef specialized in Caribbean cuisine, who will explain the link between culture and history.”\n\n\n\nWhat does the initiative mean for employees within the bank?\n\n“As Rabo Colorful we have a good sense of what is going on”, says Souad. “We have an active online community and often people come to us first to share their experiences, before they go to other colleagues. We notice that employees with a different cultural background have different challenges with regard to growing within a large organization. Skills like networking and negotiating are not always obvious. That’s why we organize workshops, connect people to mentor programs and share vacancies in our community. We want all colleagues to be and feel their authentic selves at Rabobank.”\n\nEdselline: “I like that more and more employees outside our own community are also starting to see the importance of cultural diversity. As an example, we were recently asked by the Members Council of Rabobank Utrecht to think along on the question: how can we increase our cultural diversity? We facilitated that dialogue, but also gave concrete advice and we told our story. We always get positive reactions on that. This is our way of contributing to Rabobank’s mission: ‘Growing a better world together’.”\n\nHow do you see the role of Rabo Colorful in the future?\n\n“I’m proud that we really give a voice to employees with a multicultural background”, says Souad. “We see our network becoming more active, and we want to stimulate that even more. In this way, as a board, we will be able to not only organize activities ourselves, but mostly support our members with their own initiatives and find support for that within the organization. In the end, change cannot only happen bottom-up, it also has to be top-down. That is why in the coming period, we will focus specifically on getting commitment from management teams in the bank, and have them act as our ambassadors. So that Rabo Colorful can spread across all layers of the bank. The ultimate goal?
