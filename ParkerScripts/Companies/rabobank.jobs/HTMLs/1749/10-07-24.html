Ben je echt een spin in het web en neem je graag initiatief? Maak je jezelf snel nieuwe systemen eigen en is het werken met meerdere systemen voor jou geen probleem? Dan maken we graag kennis met jou!\n\nJij & jouw functie\n\nJe zult dedicated agendabeheer uitvoeren voor een of meerdere managers binnen de afdeling W&R Innovatie, en werkzaamheden binnen het project\u002Fbusinesssupportteam oppakken. Denk hierbij aan communicatie en afdelingsbrede taken zoals het bijhouden van uitgiftelijsten, organiseren van events, bestellingen plaatsen.\n\nAls teamlid binnen het Business & Strategy Support team ben je het aanspreekpunt voor de projectteams en het managementteam van W&R Innovatie. Je ontzorgt het managementteam en werkt goed samen met de andere assistenten. We pakken processen samen op en verdelen de werklast.\n\nBinnen innovatie gaan dingen soms snel, moet er opeens een andere weg ingeslagen worden of willen we op korte termijn toch nog een afspraak plannen. Hierdoor moeten meetings verplaatst worden of moet er spontaan ruimte gemaakt worden in de agenda. Een open houding en actieve inzet is daarom van belang. Ook is het van belang dat je mensen kunt motiveren zelf hun informatie te vinden binnen de portal van de Rabobank.\n\nPrettig samenwerken\n\nBinnen het Support Team van W&R Innovatie werken meerdere collega’s, je hebt dus altijd iemand om je werk mee te bespreken.\n\n28 tot 36 uur per week is mogelijk\n\nMaandag is onze vaste kantoordag. Daarnaast is ons team op donderdag op kantoor. Gezellig samen zijn dus geen probleem!\n\nEen gemiddelde werkdag\n\nBen je benieuwd wat er op een gemiddelde werkdag op jouw to-do lijst staat? Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het agendabeheer, het management hoeft zich geen zorgen te maken over dubbele afspraken, reistijd, meeting rooms en aanmelding van bezoek op de locatie etc. Ook het team komt geregeld met vragen bij jou. “Hoe boek ik een lunch, wanneer kan ik overleggen met de manager, waar vraag ik een nieuwe OV kaart aan, mijn wachtwoord is verlopen, waar zie ik mijn vakantie uren?” et cetera. Deze vragen hoef jij niet op te lossen, wel collega’s vriendelijk en behulpzaam op weg helpen hoort erbij. Het is dus van belang dat je snel leert en de wegen binnen de Rabobank weet te vinden.\n\nJe zult op een gemiddelde dag in meerdere systemen werkzaam zijn. Zo zul je afspraken plannen in Outlook, facturen goedkeuren in SAP en reizen boeken via Egencia. Dit leren we jou, van belang is dat je dit gemakkelijk afgaat en dat je gestructureerd voor jezelf de informatie opslaat. Maar ook als je meer wilt leren over communicatie dan is het mogelijk om trainingen te volgen om bijvoorbeeld de vormgeving van de Sharepoint site op je te nemen of een kwartaalbijeenkomst op te zetten.\n\nSamen bereiken we meer dan alleen\nWe geloven in de kracht van verschillen. Juist door de verschillen van mensen te combineren worden we een nog betere bank. Jouw toekomstige collega’s verwelkomen je graag.

A USB token to unlock your computer. Storing privacy-sensitive information in the cloud. Risk Manager Jasmin Carlson, together with her colleagues, determines what is and is not allowed.","content":"Ensuring that everyone can continue to do their job\n\n“Within Dynamic Risk Management, we proactively assess operational risks, changes within systems and incidents. We look at whether the mitigating measures we have taken are still sufficient. These are measures by which we reduce security risks to a minimum. You can never eliminate risks completely, but you can reduce them to a minimum. Just like you have a lock on your door at home, for example, or a strong password on your computer.”\n\n“We not only assess the risks of applications and systems, but also the external parties we engage with. How good is their security? What is the impact of a change? And how is privacy-sensitive information handled? It is an ongoing process. In the Dynamic Risk Cycle, we identify critical processes and make sure everyone can continue to do their jobs.”\n\n“When the corona crisis started, there was suddenly a great demand for software to meet digitally and to exchange information. We used to use Skype, but it didn’t suffice on this scale. You have to find something else. We assess the risks of alternatives that fit within Rabobank’s policy, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. When using these types of cloud services and collaboration software, we advise on setting up 2-factor authentication, for example.”\n\nJust like a doctor\n\nHow does Dynamic Risk Management work in practice, we ask Jasmin. “We look at the AIC classification, the Availability, Integrity & Confidentiality. We also do a privacy impact analysis. If it goes into the cloud, then additional research is done by the cloud risk assessment team. When we put something live, we want it to be of real use to us, but we also want it to be secure, so that we are not vulnerable to hackers, for example. Cyber security and privacy are very important, especially at the bank.”\n\n“With new applications, or if there is a major change within certain existing software, we look at the pros and cons. Is the security in order? Are the right controls in place? I’m the contact person and bring all these processes together in a risk assessment. In fact, I am a kind of general practitioner. If I don’t know something exactly, then I refer you to a specialist. In the field of privacy, for example, or security. By consulting with other experts, I also gain new knowledge that I can later use in my ‘diagnoses’.”\n\nFrom Risk Professional to Risk Manager\n\n“I started working as a Risk Professional in May 2019. In this role you support the Risk Manager in the risk cycle by collecting information and preparing risk analyses. I was given a warm welcome at Rabobank. It’s a very pleasant culture. Everyone is friendly and you can ask anything. Through good coaching, I have been able to take the next step and became a Risk Manager in November 2019. As Risk Manager, you provide the business with advice. It is an interaction. We have a monitoring plan and identify and assess the risks together. That way we know not only which mitigating measures have been effectively implemented, but also which areas need more attention.”\n\n“In addition, I support our current Risk Professionals, so that those who want to progress get the same opportunities that were given to me. This is how it’s done at Rabobank. I think all my colleagues experience it that way. You get the chance to make the most of it. Sometimes you don’t even realize it”, Jasmin says with a smile.\n\nCelebrating successes together and admitting mistakes\n\nCollaboration is in Jasmin’s blood. “I played softball at top-level sports. Here, too, you stand strong together as a team. You celebrate your successes together, but you can’t always do everything right. This is what a team sport is all about: you learn to admit your own mistakes, but you also learn how to help each other when something can be done better.”\n\n“I like to pass on my knowledge. That’s where my top-level sports history comes in. I was about 14 years old when I started playing major league softball, with ladies who were 10 to 15 years older than me. They supported me in every way. Now I am older myself and train our youth. With the right guidance and instructions, they progress immensely. They are all just as eager to learn as the Risk Professionals I coach at Rabobank. That motivates me. After all, knowledge is worth nothing if you don’t share it.\n\nCreating stories that everyone understands\n\n“To do this work, you have to be, above all, an all-rounder. Someone who is a fast learner, someone who knows a little about every subject and who can make connections. You make the translation between the IT world and non-IT. You don’t just carry out the assessment, but you also have to explain it well. You have to turn it into a story that everyone understands.”\n\n“The work is really diverse. You look at the privacy aspect, the business continuity aspect, risk management, and so on for every application. Every day is different. I can use my expertise in many different activities. Sometimes it’s about communication, as in the case of e-mail traffic, and another time we’re working on the tokens you need to be able to log in at all. I find it very interesting that the IT world is constantly changing and renewing itself. Every day there is something new that you can learn from.”\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n“I’m from the 1990s, when technology was on the rise. Everyone got a computer at home and after school you would play games. My generation is used to making full use of technology. The corona crisis made us work differently and much more efficiently in that area. I think it has brought about an interesting technological improvement.”\n\n“In a very short period of time, we set everything up so that everyone could easily work from home. I think eventually we are going to find a balance between working partly in the office, but mostly at home. Even though you won’t run into each other at the coffee machine anymore, we’ve managed to keep in touch so far. I work from home, but rarely a day goes by without me talking to someone.”","createdAt":1701198206,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"dd979528e4ce","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Managing risks in a changing IT world","image":{"_key":"9e79c6fa9ed9","_type":"image","alt":"Jasmin poseert buiten met armen over elkaar","asset":{"_ref":"image-592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-networking","change-agility","communication","compliance-reporting","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","operation-risk-management","policy-development","professional-collaboration","regulatory-advice","risk-assessments","risk-reporting","risk-strategies","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"378a6915-ca84-4e83-8b5c-85973eabe449","title":"Design the bank of the future as a Business Architect","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"design-the-bank-of-the-future-as-a-business-architect"},"intro":"Creating a vision of what business processes should look like several years from now is the task of Business Architect Joost Landman. “If we wouldn’t be here, that wouldn’t be a big deal in the short term. In the medium term, it would become annoying. And in the long run, disastrous. Because then no one would have worked on building the future.”","content":"The field of Business Architecture concerns three elements, Joost explains. The structure of IT systems, the business processes that support them, and the people who work with them. “As a Business Architect, I don’t provide the IT, but rather the vision of what IT and its processes should look like in a few years. That’s what enterprise architecture is about”.\n\nFast, efficient and accurate\n\nEach business architect at Rabobank has their own domain. “I work in the Wholesale & Rural domain, which deals with wholesale clients who are based abroad and are usually related to the food chain. This includes food production, transportation and processing, but also large farms from Australia and Brazil. The business architecture under my care deals with the application and management process of these clients’ loans. It has to be as fast, efficient and accurate as possible.”\n\n\n\nMake the process work\n\nWithin this process, Joost is looking into the systems related to the application form. “And that’s not a simple form, but a huge mountain of data, from which you have to extract the right decision parameters. So that you are able to present it to someone who ultimately decides whether or not we will do business with the client.”\n\nJoost explains more about the nature of this data. “There are all kinds of issues to deal with between offer and concluded loan. Who should approve this client? And on what basis? We also perform risk and capital calculations, and for that we need to have a good understanding of the client’s business structure and financial data. Getting all that data on a scratch book or in an Excel file takes too much time. With automation and optimizations, we make this process workable.”\n\nThe dream: an end-to-end application process\n\nThe dot on the horizon? Joost refers to the beginning of the conversation. “That’s what I mean by designing the future. What we’re doing now doesn’t exist yet. A complete end-to-end application process, that’s the dream.” Joost adds that for him it’s about more than the end result. “The result is going to take years. For me, the moment of success is earlier, when I know the direction we want to go.”\n\n\n\nListen and be curious\n\nWhat qualities come in handy as a business architect? “People often think of the complex, analytical part of the job first. Of course that’s part of it, but always in consultation with colleagues. Not only are you curious about systems and processes, but you also want to know how other people think about them. The work is a lot of listening and talking (and in that order!) to arrive at the right insights.”\n\nComplex business, continuous challenges\n\nWhen asked what makes this work so interesting, Joost doesn’t have to think long. “It’s incredible to be working on the bank of the future. Rabobank is a large and complex company with continuous challenges. Not just from a regulatory perspective, but because we want to innovate as a company. The design challenges involved are simply fantastic.”\n\n","createdAt":1704375536,"updatedAt":1705055142,"representation":{"_key":"26ddc213afeb","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Design the bank of the future as a Business Architect","image":{"_key":"2585b701ae2b","_type":"image","alt":"Joost is posing","asset":{"_ref":"image-9df80d07a5f684c59238009b5d151a1f7f8bfa8a-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"1faaad0a-ec84-4f28-bc28-0e94c0d77cd3","title":"Engineering risk models with the customer at the counter in mind","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"engineering-risk-models-with-the-customer-at-the-counter-in-mind"},"intro":"Risk model engineering is a matter of building bridges, says Natacha Lord. By that, she doesn’t just mean the connection between risk models, business, data and IT. “I’m very aware that the work I do here will eventually have an impact on the customer at the counter.”","content":"“You can imagine how important risk management is for a bank. It involves constantly searching for a balance between the growth of the bank and controlling the risks. Not just the risks for the bank itself, which we limit using credit risk analyses and Asset & Liability Management (ALM). But also the bank’s contribution to a sustainable economy, as regulated in the Basel IV norms, IFRS 9 and other guidelines. The risk model engineering team plays a key role in that whole hierarchy of interests.”\n\nHelping customers\n\n“On the one hand, we implement risk calculation engines that support front line employees with customer contacts. When someone comes to the counter to apply for a loan to start their own business, the tool enables our front line colleagues to price that loan in a timely manner, taking into account the estimated credit risk based on the customer profile. Then the employee can recommend a loan to help the customer for an interest rate and term whilst balancing the risk.”\n\n“On the other hand, our team supports the back office. We’re a very large bank, so we have an important responsibility to society. We take that responsibility seriously in my team, just like the rest of the bank. On the back-office side, we ensure models can be used and that relevant key risk metrics are calculated thoroughly, swiftly and with minimum manual intervention, so that the bank is able to manage its risks.”\n\nHeaven on earth\n\n“This work involves different aspects that I really enjoy in life. One of them is mathematics; I became interested in this field at a young age, which later led to a master’s degree. At university, I also got into computer science, which became my other passion. When I did my PhD in Scotland, I was able to combine mathematics and computer science. It was like heaven on earth! I saw how theory and practice came together, how you could combine data with algorithms to gain new insights.”\n\n“After a few years working as a quant-analyst – which is really similar to being a risk model engineer – I moved into a manager position at a bank in Scotland. Manager of exactly one employee, but still… Now, at Rabobank, I lead a team of 30 plus colleagues. I still help build algorithms in my work, but I also help my employees build their knowledge and grow in their field so that we can come up with even better solutions together.”\n\nMore coach than lead\n\n“I also continue to develop myself professionally. That’s part of leadership in my opinion. As a team in a technical environment, you can only help people when you understand what they’re doing. Learning new things every day and being involved in the work myself helps me to build a relationship of trust with my people. I’m not just saying something, I actually understand what my colleagues are working on and going through. I can help them brainstorm. So I don’t see myself as a manager as much as a technical coach and servant leader, enabling the team to unlock its full potential.”\n\n“And there’s so much to learn! As risk engineers, we’re already used to building bridges between modelling and business. And now we’ve added data and IT as well. For example, in the area of platform building. We put all of our models on CAS, Rabobank’s Azure-based cloud platform. Together with our colleagues in data and IT, we ensure that CAS is fed with the right data, meets the business requirements and then correctly identifies insights. It’s a tough job, but I love it!”\n\nBetter world\n\n“Beautiful: that’s actually a good description of my whole job at Rabobank. I have the opportunity here to use both my technical and leadership skills to help my colleagues, and I can even contribute to a better society and a better world. You can see the bank’s cooperative personality reflected in the people who come to work here. The contact with my colleagues is warm and personal, from the moment I walked in the door. People take their time for you.”\n\n“And that brings me to another keyword: human. By that I don’t just mean the charity projects we’ve set up at the bank, like collecting clothes for people in need. I also mean the work itself; the risk models we implement. I’m certain that all the people in my team share the conviction that what we do here – brainstorming, programming, designing, testing – will eventually have an impact on the man or woman who comes to the counter to ask for a loan. That each of us can make a difference for the world.”","createdAt":1701419082,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"9e650185c56e","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Engineering risk models with the customer at the counter in mind","image":{"_key":"0375277a529d","_type":"image","alt":"Natacha Lord - Lead poseert","asset":{"_ref":"image-167e3003e1f417413e03990f12724160c994b01a-1032x450-png","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":null,"language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"14a6797f-ce17-4260-8a8a-85ace03b16c4","title":"The auditor of the future: people-oriented and data-driven","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-auditor-of-the-future-people-oriented-and-data-driven"},"intro":"“The bank changes, and we auditors change with it.

According to him, the auditor of the future is someone who uses innovative technologies and knows how to make an impact with them. “You can interpret data and transfer your findings to colleagues and management. Even if the message is less pleasant.”\n\nResearch culture and strategy in the organization\n\n“NextGen Audit is a program that prepares us for the future of our field. We take the next step in our technology, processes and methods, and people’s personal and professional development. We develop the most modern audit methods, such as process- and text mining. This enables us to make relevant observations about what is happening within the bank.”\n\n“Our auditors look at more than just data and processes. We also look at the behaviour of the people in our organization. For this, we use the Culture and Behavior framework. We use this to conduct research based on, among other things, questionnaires and interviews. Part of the research is how employees address each other. Both with compliments and with feedback. Our auditor of the future also looks closely at the organization’s strategy.”\n\nThe areas of expertise in Audit\n\n“We have four important domains within Rabobank. First of all, that is the Business domain. These include, for example, the bank’s activities in payment transactions, insurance, assets, customer service and financing. The second domain is KYC & Compliance. An important area for us here is that you audit all activities related to KYC and compliance, as well as HR and Legal. IT, Data & Innovation are the third domain. Here you focus on work related to technology, architecture and hardware. The fourth domain is Risk. You then work broadly in the field of credit, finance, models and general risk management.”\n\n\n\nA nice working environment\n\n“With Agile@Audit methodology, we put together our audit teams in an agile way. We have cross-functional teams that are responsible for their part of Rabobank. This decentralized way of working allows us to adapt to the rapidly changing world in and around the bank.”\n\n“I believe in the added value of a diversely composed audit team. We have colleagues with extensive work experience as auditors or accountants, such as RA or RE training. We also have colleagues from different backgrounds, such as sociology or philosophy. Many of our auditors have gained expertise in the company or the risk or compliance organization.”\n\n\"Within Rabobank, we work with the principles of Rabo@anywhere (https:\u002F\u002Frabobank.jobs\u002Fen\u002Fgrow-magazine\u002Fraboanywhere-the-new-way-of-working-after-corona\u002F). This means that we have great flexibility when working independently of time and place. We divide our workweek to work from home, from one of Rabobank’s central offices, and sometimes from a local office nearby.\"\n\nYou make the difference\n\n“We work at one of the largest audit departments in the Netherlands.

They enable data-driven and adequate decision making. This is what makes Modelling Consultant Paula enjoy her work. Navigating her way through a complex web of internal and external stakeholders, she works hard to contribute to the development of the best possible predictive models. She comes from Lithuania, but Rabobank feels like home to her, thanks to the close community of like-minded data professionals she's part of. She wouldn't trade her job for the world and is happy to share why.","content":"Being the linking pin\n\n‘Working in the field of Data Science is truly one of the most exciting things you can do within the bank. As a Modelling Consultant I’m responsible for supporting the development and maintenance of Rabobank’s credit risk models. It’s an extremely versatile job because our models have a big impact and are interwoven with pretty much every business department and their processes. We are truly the heart of the bank and I’m in the middle of it all. The linking pin within a very extensive and dynamic stakeholder field.’\n\n‘Important stakeholders are the colleagues who actually need to work with our credit risk models. Analysts, who determine whether and what type of loan a client gets, for example, or make capital calculations with the help of our models. We also work closely with the data team to make processes more efficient. For the implementation of the models, we turn to colleagues from IT. And for independent internal challenge, there are dedicated model validation and audit teams. Finally, there’s an external stakeholder from who we need approval: the ECB. The challenge for me is to keep close contact with all these stakeholders and make sure the process of model development runs smoothly within a complex quantitative and regulatory framework. Hereby ensuring that business needs are being met.’\n\nThe necessity of models\n\n‘To explain the function of a model, I always refer to the essence of banking: helping people and society financially. By providing loans or credit facilities, Rabobank helps people to run their business or buy a house. But loans obviously carry risks. That’s where models come in. We use credit risk models to predict the probability that a client won’t be able to pay back their loan and what the expected loss would be for the bank, all based on data. A lot of data. So to make these estimations manually would be a very complex and inefficient exercise. Models are indispensable for banking. Without them, Rabobank would never be as efficient as it is now.’\n\nData-driven, compliant decision making\n\n‘To me, this job really matters. Models are the driving force behind the bank, because practically every aspect of banking depends on it, for example, client acceptance, pricing, capital calculations. They are used in everyday business processes, supporting effective, data-driven and compliant decision making for us to be and stay a future-proof bank. Therefore it’s a huge responsibility to make accurate and trustworthy predictions with our credit risk models. Not only the quality of our products depends on it, but the way we help clients and the way we fulfill our role in society as a financial institution.’\n\nAnalytics community\n\n‘Another aspect that makes my work so valuable, is the team. We all have a different background in education, culture and age, but we also have a lot in common. What I love is that we challenge each other to stay on our toes. We are eager to learn, to teach and we encourage each other.’\n\n‘Because of our shared talents, interests, and our close collaboration, I feel like I’m part of an analytics community within Rabobank. This feeling is a big part of what keeps me motivated and interested. I’m from Lithuania originally, and my family lives over there. But my team over here is so much fun, I see them as my work family. A family of highly intelligent and kind people. ‘\n\n","createdAt":1701165033,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"9d4f41a73038","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working at the heart of the bank, making it future-proof with predictive models","image":{"_key":"5ac9e3ad56f0","_type":"image","alt":"Paule outside at cycling path in front of Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-4f3a0dfcfc8d617aa0907a3fd666d38b488b8100-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"c99815e5-3c50-4441-9bae-62f113179a4d","title":"Contributing to society with data","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"contributing-to-society-with-data-michel-van-dijck"},"intro":"\"The enormous amount of data that the bank has is only usable when you structure the data ánd consider all the variables.\" Michel van Dijck works as a Data Engineer at Rabobank and ensures, among other things, that the models that combat financial crime are always provided with the right data.","content":"\"Together with data scientists, we engage in models that make predictions based on customer behavior. In short, the data scientists come up with the models and the data engineers in the Data Fundaments & Model Operations team make sure they are fed with well-structured data. We also ensure that the models in production operate stably. ”\n\n\"Our models help other departments within the bank do their jobs. I work primarily on models that try to detect financial crime, such as the Source of Funds model. The model looks at the money coming in over a period of time. How much growth is there, how fast was it? There are really a lot of variables that we factor in. If something catches our eye, someone suddenly transferring large sums of money, we automatically forward that to a team of analysts who further investigate what exactly is going on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking raw data usable for models\n\n\"At the bank, you have access to a lot of raw data from different sources: from customers, accounts, organizations, industries, and so on. As a data engineer, you structure that data with the prerequisites of the data scientists. We work closely together, because you have to coordinate this well. We combine the data into a useful set for the model.\"\n\n\"In addition, we make sure the models keep running well in practice. You set up the production environment and test extensively to make sure everything is working properly. Is the model functioning as expected, is all the data available, is the output correct? We do this together with the platform teams, they maintain the servers on which the model runs. Once a model is in production, we continuously monitor how it's doing and fix problems as they arise.\"\n\n\"Right now I am working on migrating our models to Azure, Microsoft's cloud environment. This is quite a challenge for our department. Because we want to make sure everything keeps working well, we now run our systems in parallel on our own systems as well as in the cloud.\"\n\n\n\nGaining and sharing knowledge\n\n\"I like to work on long-term projects. Then I can get all caught up in it. That's why I love working at a bank. I have the space to focus on one subject so that I can grow and learn in it. And what remains really cool is that huge amount of data you can work with. A gold mine! You can develop so many services with it. We create models that personalize the Rabo App or help categorize expenses.\"\n\n\"What you learn, you also share with each other. Once a month, the entire Area Data Science meets to share knowledge. Anyone who wants to share something or have a discussion on a particular topic can do so. You can talk about your own project, or discuss a new package or library. It is completely free to fill in. I gave a session myself on new customer data-based datasets, what's in there and how to use it within different projects.\"\n\n\n\nWork that matters\n\n“You don’t notice at all that you work at a bank. Today’s banks are actually very large IT companies with a banking license in which data plays an increasingly important role. I have yet to encounter the stereotypical banker in jacket-tie in my department. When I just started here, I did always put on a dress shirt, or something quite formal,” Michel laughs now. “Until I saw my manager walking around in Air Max and a T-shirt. The atmosphere is very relaxed and everyone is open to questions from each other.”\n\n“All in all, I feel like I’m really making an impact here. Not only for the bank, but also for society. I worked on use cases focused on marketing in a previous job as a data engineer, but that commercial angle did not suit me as well. The work I do now plays out in the community. I think it is important to contribute to countering financial crime, such as money laundering. I feel I can really make a difference to society and that gives me great satisfaction.”","createdAt":1700558883,"updatedAt":1702978827,"representation":{"_key":"7f2e43965a8e","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Contributing to society with data","image":{"_key":"f542d00bb4cf","_type":"image","alt":"Man in front of stairs","asset":{"_ref":"image-1103ca0796d395033294027bc1a5822da48e575d-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"49a2bffd-c7d7-42d3-b3be-0c85ca1eeed4","title":"Globally consistent and high quality data, that's the work of a Data Steward","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"globally-consistent-and-high-quality-data-thats-the-work-of-a-data-steward"},"intro":"Lara Meester started working as a Data Analyst at Rabobank two years ago, and quickly developed into a Data Steward. Within this role, she works on a large customer data project to clarify Rabobank’s global data. ‘This will make our colleagues’ work much easier.’","content":"“I don’t have a background in finance, but I was able to start as a junior Data Analyst via a traineeship. The bank and I immediately ‘clicked’, both with the work and the other colleagues. Since then, I’ve worked my way up to the position of Data Steward. Another Steward left, and I thought that was a good moment to grow into that position. My manager had the same idea. That’s one of the things I like about Rabobank: you get the support you need to realize your ambitions. Data analysis is a great job, but the work of the Data Steward is also fascinating to me. As an analyst, you focus more on the differences between the new system and the old one. As a data steward, you think about whether those differences are actually an improvement.”\n\nDozens of systems\n\n“At the moment, I’m working as Data Steward on a project where we’re migrating the different customer systems to a single customer system worldwide. That’s as interesting as it is complex. Right now, the bank is using all sorts of customer systems; some are even specific to the region. The data from all those systems flow to our data warehouse, which our team is responsible for. But the data from a customer system in Chile, for example, could be defined differently than in Utrecht or New York. In one system, the main office in the country might be the location address, while in another country it might be the local office. Some systems might include certain data elements, while others don’t. In short: the data is incomplete and unclear.”\n\nHigher quality\n\n“If we work with the same customer system around the world, then we’ll only need to connect a single system to our data warehouse. That’s much more efficient. Plus, we’ll work with the same data and the same definitions everywhere. As Data Steward, I help decide what those data definitions will be. That standardization will help improve the quality of the data. This means the Data Quality team – which is responsible for correcting the data – won’t have as much work to do. The reporting teams will also be happy with the higher quality. They’ll be able to submit more complete, better-quality reports to the Dutch and European central banks.”\n\nLearning from each other\n\n“You can only complete a big project like that through good teamwork. During the test phases for the new system, we have an update meeting every morning with the reporting teams, the implementation manager and IT. I learn a lot from that. And in our own team, we constantly keep each other up to date through weekly meetings. The team consists of around 25 Data Analysts, Data Stewards, Product Owners and Implementation Managers. Every colleague has his or her own projects, but everyone is glad to help if you have a question or would like to spar with someone. I think that’s important for the quality of our work, and for the atmosphere.”\n\nIdeal mix\n\n“Rabobank welcomes hybrid working so I mainly talk to my colleagues online. That meant that I was able to work remotely from Spain for several weeks. I think working part of the time from home and part of the time at the office is an ideal mix. The home office facilities are great; the bank’s provided a sit-stand adjustable desk and an additional screen.”\n\nComplex\n\n“Why do I enjoy my work? At Rabobank, you work with so much data; that makes the work extremely complex. What are the critical data elements? What about the governance aspects? How are the data used for analysis? How do you keep the quality of data as high as possible? I love solving puzzles, so these are the kinds of questions I like to sink my teeth into. It’s also interesting to work with a programming language like SQL. I can use an SQL query to look for the specific data that I need. I also work with Knime, which allows you to automate data comparisons. I learn something new every day in this place, so it’s a perfect fit for me.”","createdAt":1700839357,"updatedAt":1703005969,"representation":{"_key":"207960ebf077","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"title":"The work of a Data Steward","label":"article","image":{"_key":"ee098fd8078c","_type":"image","alt":"Lara Meester - tijdelijk ","asset":{"_ref":"image-8057d6ec6636af5e59d20b824d9b00b61ed5d329-722x399-png","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-acumen","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","data-modeling","data-quality","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","programming-languages","requirements-analysis","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","rabo-anywhere"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"34c82c34-1f56-4d76-beb6-249f142a20bf","title":"Working together for change: IT Lead Martijn’s mission","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-together-for-change-it-lead-martijns-mission"},"intro":"When Martijn Groen joined Rabobank 11 years ago, he was working with a six-person team on data solutions. Today that team is 350 colleagues strong and data has never been so important. Martijn spoke to us about his job as IT Lead, about the Global Data Platform, his role as an ambassador, and his vision for change. As he sees it, “we have to work together to create a better world.”","content":"Global Data Platform\n\n“As IT Lead, I work with my teams on the Global Data Platform. This is the platform used to gather, analyze, manage, and process all of Rabobank’s customer data. It makes it possible for different parties within the bank to exchange data rapidly and easily and helps us improve our services. I like the challenge of working on this with excellent, skilled colleagues, and encouraging them to deliver their very best.”\n\n“The engineers on my teams are responsible for IT services and solutions, but their work involves much more than providing services. We value our Engineering Culture, which is highly employee-oriented. It helps colleagues discover what their talents and ambitions are, while exploring how Rabobank can help them achieve their goals and hone their talents. As IT Lead, I’m responsible for this process and I coach members of the team to reach their full potential. Cooperating this way leads to more innovative ideas and solutions.”\n\n\n\n“Rabobank is a top IT company in the Netherlands with endless opportunities. This makes the work environment thrilling. However, the dynamic projects are not the only attraction for me. I work at Rabobank because it offers more than just the listed job duties. There’s scope for growth in all areas and the company encourages employees to contribute to its mission of making the world a better place.”\n\n\n\nGrowing a better world together\n\n“When we talk about our mission, a lot of people wonder what we’re actually doing. For me, pursuing our mission is something I do outside of work. For example, I am also an ambassador at the Junior IoT in Alkmaar. We give children the opportunity to learn about technology. They learn soldering, programming, and experimenting. Every year we have a Robot Wars event, and the kids wage battles between the robots they built themselves.”\n\n“The Junior IoT foundation came across my path when a colleague told me about it and asked if I wanted to get involved. One day I hopped on my bike and went to see what it was all about. It’s in Alkmaar after all, where I live. I saw it and thought, ‘hey, that’s cool.’ Eventually I arranged for the local Rabobank in Alkmaar to sponsor the foundation and we helped to professionalize it. The sponsoring has ended, but I still volunteer there. I get energy from it and I think it’s important that children learn to work with technology. That’s going to mean a lot to us in the future.”\n\n\n\nMore than “working in IT”\n\n“If you work at headquarters, Rabobank’s regional activities don’t always register on your radar. But if you take the time to have a chat with employees at a local Rabobank, you realize how much we really do to support regional initiatives. That’s how I discovered Artiance too, a center for arts and culture in Alkmaar.”\n\n“During the corona lockdown, Artiance had to stop their music and dance lessons. I helped them explore the possibilities of a digital platform. Rabobank sponsored and led part of that transition. My work as an ambassador is my way of giving substance to Rabobank’s mission of having a positive social impact.”\n\n\n\nWorking together for change\n\n“In my work I also think a lot about how we could do things better. We are in the middle of the process of transitioning to the cloud. The data centers are working overtime. So to save energy, we are exploring ways to improve the efficiency of our processes. We want to use state-of-the-art techniques to find smart solutions that work for us and keep the impact on the environment to a minimum.”\n\n“We are not doing it alone, either. We are in close contact with Microsoft in Seattle. It’s great to see how well we can work with them; they take us seriously. I’m always pleased to see people working together for positive change.”\n\n“Often, individuals can change things that they are directly involved with. We can achieve more through cooperation. I see it at work, when different colleagues manage to get a lot done together. But by working with the right outside parties, locally and internationally, we can achieve more and help each other improve.”","createdAt":1704362014,"updatedAt":1705419857,"representation":{"_key":"30343cbccf50","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working together for change: IT Lead Martijn’s mission","image":{"_key":"949e9755156a","_type":"image","alt":"Man is smiling","asset":{"_ref":"image-b21aaa41991425ce8404573b87ed210970db7781-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","social-innovation"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"8b70d08f-f40c-4b67-abea-c03d822c160b","title":"Knowledge is gold, as is evidenced by the communities","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"knowledge-is-gold-as-is-evidenced-by-the-communities"},"intro":"Community Manager Chris Stapper is building strong IT communities at Rabobank, where colleagues exchange knowledge about specific themes.

Of course you can then delve into the functionalities yourself. However, it’s a waste of time to reinvent the wheel when there are colleagues at the bank who are expert users of the tool. On the other hand, finding that person in a company with more than 8,000 IT colleagues is a challenge. I make sure that IT enthusiasts at the bank can find each other when they have specific IT related questions.”\n\n“I do that by setting up new communities where necessary and maintaining the existing ones. We organise events, workshops and recurring meetings to keep one another informed. And that’s necessary, as we are working in a large organisation with many wishes, ideas and working methods. In the communities we share best practices and come up with new plans. Rabobank is a frontrunner in this field.”\n\n\n\nThe need for a Python community\n\n“A great example: a Python community was set up in no time the other day. An increasing number of people at the bank are working with this programming language, and I was wondering if they might feel the need to share some thoughts with each other about it. I put the question to a large group of developers, and I soon got reactions from all corners of the bank. Many colleagues said they thought it was great to exchange more knowledge about Python.”\n\n“I organised an event to get all those interested at the table together. There was plenty to talk about. All kinds of problems and solutions were exchanged at an incredible speed. At that moment, I realised that such a community adds value for its member immediately. And that’s what I like about my job: that I can help people who want to learn and coach them in their development.”\n\nA visit from Uncle Bob\n\n“The communities not only exist to enhance the expertise within the bank. They also help to discover which knowledge is still missing. When we organise an event, we gauge in the communities what people feel they need. Last year the highly regarded American software developer Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, came to visit us. He dealt with a number of themes that had been put forward by our developers. It was a great success! If the knowledge exchange in the organisation is well structured, you get a good idea of the knowledge that is still missing. That enables you to organise speakers and workshops in a very targeted way. That’s another way in which communities add a lot of value!”\n\nCool idea built within one month\n\n“A couple of months ago, a colleague from the ‘quality software community’ pitched a concept for building the Dynatrace unbreakable pipeline. After the presentation someone shouted: ‘I know for whom this is relevant!’ And someone else offered to build it. I find that kind of enthusiasm incredibly cool. The concept was developed within just one month. There was a lot of interest during the presentation of the pipeline: it attracted more than 100 colleagues. I think it’s great that you can act rapidly here when you have a good idea.”","createdAt":1704377725,"updatedAt":1704377932,"representation":{"_key":"fe6478b0c39d","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Knowledge is gold, as is evidenced by the communities","image":{"_key":"d6b4877809d4","_type":"image","alt":"Chris is posing","asset":{"_ref":"image-de6b887427a8f56001581843406c1bc9280b8716-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"3cc07666-1265-41e3-8f9c-07b4480f32ef","title":"Network ‘Rabo Colourful’ aims for more cultural diversity","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"network-colorful-rabo-aims-for-more-cultural-diversity"},"intro":"Rabo Colorful is the internal network for and by employees with a bi-cultural background.

We strive for positive awareness of cultural diversity. We share experiences, give each other tips, support each other and organize events. We are the face of a colorful organization and provide guidance on cultural diversity topics within Rabobank”, tells Edselline.\n\n“In 2020, during the Black Lives Matter-protests, I felt a strong need to commit myself to creating more awareness of discrimination, prejudice, and racism. With my team I already recorded a video about this. I looked for like-minded people within the bank with whom I could talk about these things. That’s how I discovered Rabo Colorful and eventually, I joined the board. Now I can work on awareness much more broadly, outside my own team.”\n\n“I believe that as Rabobank we should reflect society”, says Souad. “Our customers are also very diverse. With more cultural diversity in the office, you will get more varied perspectives. Diversity is now also an important theme within the organization. For example, HR has a strategy for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with clear, measurable goals. As Rabo Colorful we actively commit to this.”\n\nRabo Colorful has over 275 members and a renewed board since the end of 2022, which now consists of 7 board members: Edselline Jozephia, Odessa Tseng, Diejana van der Wal (chair), Souad el Kholte, Anne-Marie Breuker, Nourelhouda Kassi and Patrick Sanwikarja (in the photo from left to right).\n\n\n\nKeti Koti and Ramadan\n\nAwareness, Commitment, and Empowerment: these are the main priorities of Rabo Colorful. Edselline explains: “We organize different events. Last year, for our 5-year anniversary, we organized an event together with RaboWomen, another diversity network. We invited Marian Spier, who has written the book Impact, about personal and business leadership. Together with her, we looked ahead: what else can we do to make Rabobank more colorful?”\n\nSouad: “And this past spring we organized our ‘Colorful Dinner' – an iftar with about 100 employees. An iftar is the breaking of the fast during Ramadan, the meal after sunset. Also here we had an inspiring speaker and meaningful conversations at the dinner table. Ramadan is so much more than only fasting. These kinds of events work really well to bring people together and raise awareness.”\n\nEdselline: “This year we especially want to focus on Keti Koti, on July 1st. On that day, it is 150 years ago that the Netherlands abolished slavery. A day to commemorate, but also to celebrate. Keti Koti is not only a meaningful day for the people in our community, but for all of the Netherlands. What is nice is that members from our community approached us with ideas for an event. We embraced that and together with them, we will organize a Keti Koti-event, this fall. On the one hand, we want to increase awareness on our history and how it still affects people today. A lot of people don’t know what Keti Koti means. On the other hand, again, we want to bring people from the bank together. And also here, food connects us. So we will invite a chef specialized in Caribbean cuisine, who will explain the link between culture and history.”\n\n\n\nWhat does the initiative mean for employees within the bank?\n\n“As Rabo Colorful we have a good sense of what is going on”, says Souad. “We have an active online community and often people come to us first to share their experiences, before they go to other colleagues. We notice that employees with a different cultural background have different challenges with regard to growing within a large organization. Skills like networking and negotiating are not always obvious. That’s why we organize workshops, connect people to mentor programs and share vacancies in our community. We want all colleagues to be and feel their authentic selves at Rabobank.”\n\nEdselline: “I like that more and more employees outside our own community are also starting to see the importance of cultural diversity. As an example, we were recently asked by the Members Council of Rabobank Utrecht to think along on the question: how can we increase our cultural diversity? We facilitated that dialogue, but also gave concrete advice and we told our story. We always get positive reactions on that. This is our way of contributing to Rabobank’s mission: ‘Growing a better world together’.”\n\nHow do you see the role of Rabo Colorful in the future?\n\n“I’m proud that we really give a voice to employees with a multicultural background”, says Souad. “We see our network becoming more active, and we want to stimulate that even more. In this way, as a board, we will be able to not only organize activities ourselves, but mostly support our members with their own initiatives and find support for that within the organization. In the end, change cannot only happen bottom-up, it also has to be top-down. That is why in the coming period, we will focus specifically on getting commitment from management teams in the bank, and have them act as our ambassadors. So that Rabo Colorful can spread across all layers of the bank. The ultimate goal? I hope that one day we will no longer be needed within the organization.”","createdAt":1701185417,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"4b002e514d98","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Network ‘Rabo Colourful’ aims for more cultural diversity","image":{"_key":"46823e8fc5ae","_type":"image","alt":"Board Colorful Rabo","asset":{"_ref":"image-ff8287ea45e3694d337ffffb9f9d8d54d0cbead9-2048x1362-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"hr","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"f4d65a8d-4ad0-4591-8193-8858ffc27d7b","title":"Working hybrid from another country: chances & challenges","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-hybrid-from-another-country-things-to-pay-attention-to"},"intro":"Digital working - known as Digital First - is a starting point at Rabobank: you consciously choose when to go to the office for your work or to meet colleagues or customers. But can this also be done from abroad? And what are the challenges? We spoke with Martin Dijkman, Product Manager Investment at Rabobank, who also worked abroad occasionally before the corona crisis.","content":"\"Before I started at Rabobank, I have lived and worked in Spain for 9 years. I still have a house there and because my wife is Spanish, I go there often for family visits and vacations. It's a beautiful country!\"\n\n\"Even before the the coronacrisis started, I worked from Spain every now and then for short periods of time. That was done in agreement with my manager and with good arrangements with my team. Together you look at how you can make it work. Now that we are all used to hybrid working, it has become a bit easier. Everyone knows what works digitally and what doesn’t work, and the resources are a lot better. The way we use Teams, for example, is a huge improvement over the past.\"\n\nTrust and responsibility\n\n\"The work that my team does can easily be done from home. Together we work on making the online application for 'Rabo Beheerd Beleggen' as customer-friendly as possible, while at the same time complying with all the legal requirements that investing involves. Rabobank is a cooperative bank and does things differently than other banks. We work together with clients and take the time to look at the long term. It's a great mission to get people to invest responsibly and help them with a financially healthy future. That motivates me.\"\n\n\"At Rabobank, there was always the option of working from home for 1 or 2 days. You get a lot of freedom and trust and if you make good use of that and take responsibility, a lot is possible. We look at what people are contributing. It doesn't matter whether you do that between 9 and 5 or spread it out over the morning and evening. In my team, many people have young children and they may be absent during the day, but they make up for it in the evening.\"\n\nThings to consider when working hybrid\n\n\"The move to a true form of hybrid working has been relatively seamless for my team. Of course, we had to start doing some things differently. When you're not all in the same room at a stand-up, it's important to be patient and to let each other finish. People have a strong tendency to jump straight into something, but that is not possible in a situation where some people are working at home. An additional advantage: you learn to listen better.\"\n\n\"With substantial sessions on legislation and regulations, you do notice that it is more difficult to do that online. Also when we are going to build something new and we have complex, technical discussions, I find that it is better to do this face-to-face. Especially if the technology is new to us. It is nice to be in the office one day a week. Fully online is possible, but then you need more time to understand each other. It is more effective when you can look each other in the eye to respond to each other's views and give feedback.\"\n\n\"What has really changed is the onboarding of new people. How do they build their network? How do you make them feel involved? Our newest colleague handled that smartly. I had paired her with a number of team members to get acquainted. She, in turn, asked those colleagues who else she needed to talk to. In this way, she spoke to a lot of people in a short period of time. Something you would normally do at the coffee machine. I thought this was a great learning, a smart way to quickly expand your network in a hybrid situation.\"\n\nThe variety of a different country\n\n\"Hybrid working can be done in different ways. For example, I work from my home in Madrid during school holidays. My type of work can be done anywhere, but that doesn't apply to all positions within Rabobank. Because of security, because you do confidential work, or because you are in direct contact with customers, such as our customer service employees or colleagues at local banks.\"\n\n\"You also can't just go live abroad and work in the Netherlands. You're bound by strict tax rules from the Dutch government and Rabobank also sets limits on how long you can stay abroad. I myself see it as a great privilege to live in two worlds. When you work in a different country, with a different work culture, you learn to adapt quickly.\"\n\n\"Of course life is different in Spain: its more outdoors. Although it's no longer the case that everything is closed in the afternoon and everyone takes a siesta, it is quite normal, for example, to have lunch somewhere in the afternoon. As long as it fits into my schedule and there are no important meetings, I can do that. Then I just work a little longer in the evening.\"\n\n\"When I'm in Spain I immediately have a relaxed feeling. That's because everything is just a little bit different. It's the variety, the atmosphere and the people. As soon as I'm there I feel like I’m on vacation, even though I'm working.\"\n\n","createdAt":1701701905,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"1da86ddacfb1","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working hybrid from another country: chances & challenges","image":{"_key":"85f28083ea16","_type":"image","alt":"Martin Dijkman leaning against a window in the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-948b161cbe3b574ea9065d18104f599c8672b15b-1920x1280-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-networking","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","cross-functional-teamwork","data-insights","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","product-development","professional-collaboration","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["rabo-anywhere","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"3d3d55ef-ae2c-4cba-9b92-f5df5c0a6632","title":"Using data to make the world a better place","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"using-data-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-edwin-otten"},"intro":"Within Rabobank, a huge amount of data is available. But you can't do much with just data alone. The numbers need to be interpreted. For that you need BI Engineers.","content":"The air traffic controller of data flow\n\n\"If you want to do this work, you really have to enjoy doing puzzles. There is an enormous amount of data available within the bank. Data is the new gold, they say. But all that data in itself has no meaning. As a Business Intelligence Engineer you collect data, structure it and see what needs to be done with it. Well-structured data helps colleagues to understand what the numbers mean.\"\n\n\"You have to have a good overview and be analytical in order to do this well. These are the most important skills. You're like an air traffic controller who keeps an eye on all those data flows and guides them in the right direction.\"\n\n\"In addition, it's helpful if you have the ability to think abstractly. Answering questions using data often seems simple. For example, we keep track of how many customers need a review. In doing so, you're not only dealing with new and existing customers who get an annual review, but also with customers who are flagged by the Risico Detectie Toets. \n\nSuppose you process a large number of files, but the total still continues to rise sharply. We make it clear why this is happening. A rising trend is not only caused by fewer files in a category, but also by shifts within the customer groups. I like to think about the calculations we need for this. The more complex, the better!\"\n\nBringing order to chaos\n\n\"My area of expertise is more than just crunching numbers. Well-structured data helps you make smarter decisions. You bring order to chaos so that numbers become meaningful. That's the beauty of working with data, it's not as one-sided as you think. There are always better ways of doing something with it. It's like working on a huge puzzle. How can you get the most information out of it.\"\n\nKnow your customer\n\n\"I am working with Global CAMS (Compliance, Anti Money Laundering and Sanctions). This is one of our larger data models that we use to do analysis and trend reporting in the area of FEC (Financial Economic Crime). For the bank, it is important to know who our customers are. Because only if you know your customers well can you service them properly. But also: intervene if money laundering or terrorist financing is suspected. Data is essential for this.\"\n\n\"Business intelligence is about facts and dimensions. A fact, for example, is that someone has made a transaction. In itself that doesn't say much, but when you add all kinds of dimensions to it, it becomes meaningful. To which country did the transaction go, on which date and what currency are we talking about, for example.\"\n\n\"If you have to extract these kinds of things from the raw data, you can spend days doing it. We discover the connections between things you don't see at first glance. To do that, I create databases and data visualizations with Microsoft BI Suite and Power BI, among others. This allows my colleagues to assess whether there is actually something going on with a customer.\"\n\nThe impact of data on society\n\nWhat's the best part about working with Global CAMS? Edwin doesn't have to think about it for long. \"It's really a hot topic within the financial world. The impact on society is very big. The regulations surrounding money laundering and financing of terrorism is not the sexiest of issues, but these kinds of practices do leave their mark on society. Doing something about this fits in with the bank's mission: growing a better world together. This positive message appeals to me, because secretly I'm a real do-gooder myself.\"","createdAt":1701368555,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"99b1ab5bb5c7","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Using data to make the world a better place","image":{"_key":"0e0685795096","_type":"image","alt":"Edwin-Otten-headerbeeld","asset":{"_ref":"image-347eaea376e97f4aec94025c76cee879f2f13e7c-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["change-agility","cloud-computing","customer-focused","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","distributed-systems","information-technology-security","information-technology-strategies","problem-management","solution-architecture","technology-landscape"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"64609956-5dd3-4db4-bde3-ec859d298a5f","title":"You learn the most off the beaten track","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"buiten-de-gebaande-paden-leer-je-het-meest-baharak-sabourian"},"intro":"Those who do good, well met. If there's one thing Baharak Sabourian is living proof of, it's the principle of reciprocity. The opportunities she has been given, created and seized, she tries to offer others as well. As a lawyer, she didn't expect to ever work in a bank. She talks about her special career, which is built on a foundation of gratitude, eagerness to learn and perseverance.","content":"Nothing is self-evident\n\nA life lesson I learned early on is that you shouldn't take anything for granted, you have to do it yourself. As a child, I was determined to become a lawyer. My childhood in Iran unleashed in me a fighting spirit for justice. My parents gave up everything there to give their children a promising life, so it was up to me to seize the opportunities. Once in the Netherlands, I did my best to get my high school diploma so I could go to university. This in a culture I didn't know and a language I didn't speak yet. But with the right mentality, good facilities and support, especially from my parents, I succeeded. I am very grateful to them, but also to Dutch society'.\n\nAlways looking for a challenge\n\n“My career is a journey I really enjoy. At every destination I learn something new and am challenged. That's what I need. So after law school I went into the legal profession. I developed communication skills from which I have benefited throughout my career. After five years, however, I quit the profession. I thought it was too commercial and wanted to serve the public interest instead of one client. That was when the financial crisis broke out. That frenzy was reason for me to join the Ministry of Finance. As a policy advisor, I was able to do my bit to get society out of the crisis in a healthy way. I just didn't have the right financial background, so I followed a Financial Law course in the evening hours. Both in theory and in practice, I learned a lot during that period as well. And when the ministry calmed down after the crisis, it was time for me to go.”\n\n“After that, I made some remarkable career moves. For example, I worked for a foundation that was a shareholder of state-supported financial institutions, including ABN AMRO, and for an international pepper company. Each sector has its own dynamics, which makes it interesting for me. That's why my resume shows a mix of legal, financial and political functions and I have both commercial and social experience. I'm not a standard banker and that's exactly why I'm at Rabobank. We're a cooperative, so you work with a wide variety of partners. As chairman of the board of a local bank in particular, you have to be versatile and have knowledge of the various strengths, customers and other stakeholders. And having a heart for society, that's one thing that's certain. When I started here, I really was impressed by how socially involved all my colleagues are. I haven't seen that anywhere else.”\n\nGive something back\n\n“Where I am now, I also owe a debt to other people. My parents, mentors, women who worked above me; they helped me with advice and action. When I was 30 years old, I was already on the Supervisory Board of Care Netherlands, an organisation that offers humanitarian support to people who desperately need it. That wouldn't have happened if former councillors and politicians Lousewies van der Laan and Loek Hermans hadn't believed in me. Now I'm on the Supervisory Board at Kunsthal Rotterdam and Albeda College and I try to do the same: give people a chance. I've gained a lot of love, trust and a stage myself, but I realize that not everyone gets that. VET's are the driving force behind society; if I can offer them a helping hand, I will do so. The students and the artists also give me valuable social insight, each in his or her own way as a gauge of what is going on in society. I then consider it my task to do something with that. If I look back at the day in which the people around me are healthy and together we have made the world in which we live a little better, then it has been a successful day for me.”","createdAt":1700838523,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"bb70de85842d","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"You learn the most off the beaten track","image":{"_key":"e406bae76fde","_type":"image","alt":"Baharak-Sabourian in hal croeselaan","asset":{"_ref":"image-ce3affda3dd154a4217056a478d5686ec9c61d62-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","leadership"],"vakgebied":"customer-product","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"panelPage","id":"3e2124ce-79ba-4ad1-afca-542c0a7027b6","title":"Benefits","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"benefits"},"intro":"","content":"","createdAt":1701351544,"updatedAt":1716282091,"representation":{"_key":"9593003f24a8","_type":"tileImage","image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Colleague sitting behind desk","asset":{"_ref":"image-be8c4826fff0cdcfc9e52c3454883076dec7d71d-6720x4480-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.6940336562978074,"width":0.44528301886792465,"x":0.5,"y":0.5}},"title":"Benefits","label":"panelPage"},"proofPoints":["way-of-working","work-culture"],"language":"en","_type":"panelPage"}]}}--><ul class="_79796c68cf5911fbd2dbd74422b69f16"><li class="ab5e6d97237498e01dc155feddef0354 ebca9b82ae8da6d5f010fd3485009826" style="grid-area: amp; opacity: 1; transform: none;"><button aria-label="My skills" class="_161ac6961b45fbbb9fa7d8a502dcea14" data-x="link-to-skillsmatchportal" type="button">My skills</button></li><li class="ab5e6d97237498e01dc155feddef0354" style="grid-area: tile-1; opacity: 1; transform: none;"><div class="_52d39cfefd3c69f6924b373a833705ed" data-style-context="dark"><div class="deb1fa11d14958ceb2de143c0e1dd0cf _8702b2bb1aa14dfd61475654a9f56071"><div class="_945ec308dc1c653fb4919cb4edfca994" style="opacity:1"><a class="_6930d9e9433190165ee5fb0cc67909b4" data-x="link-to-article" href="/en/article/the-role-of-risk-management-jasmin-carlson/" target="_self"><span class="a1edbe1701f29ccf5681f3198aee0b10">Managing risks in a changing IT world</span></a></div><div class="_880ea949a6d3fb3d59a0527dd31361d9"><img alt="Jasmin poseert buiten met armen over elkaar" class="" height="3413.3333333333335" sizes="281.25px" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=2560&amp;h=3413&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=648,0,1264,1707&amp;w=20&amp;h=27&amp;blur=20&amp;q=0&amp;auto=format 1w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=641,0,1279,1707&amp;w=320&amp;h=427&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 320w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=480&amp;h=640&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 480w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=720&amp;h=960&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 720w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1281,1707&amp;w=1024&amp;h=1365&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1024w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=1440&amp;h=1920&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1440w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=1920&amp;h=2560&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1920w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=2400&amp;h=3200&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 2400w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/592a0dc0ddb78cf6afd8dad2492daf746515eb59-2560x1707.jpg?rect=640,0,1280,1707&amp;w=2560&amp;h=3413&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 2560w" style="object-fit: cover;" width="2560"/></div><div class="_5b17a06c66cac7963d12b875e99ad958"><div class="ba931bd49a48d7ec89f9072d22b4656a" style="opacity:1">Article</div><div class="_774ada7a514ff51436128eb00267b57a"><span role="presentation"><svg fill="none" height="16" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
