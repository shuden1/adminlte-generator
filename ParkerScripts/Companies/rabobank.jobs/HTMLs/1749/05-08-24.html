After more than 30 years at Rabobank, people know where to find her. We spoke to Judith about her mission and personal conviction that 'working together will get you further'. Her desire for innovation and about her journey: from a desk job to being Director of the Cooperative Rabobank District Zuid-Holland. \"Dare to do what you want to do.\"","content":"\"I always look for the place I can learn the most,\" Judith says enthusiastically. She has been Director of the Cooperative Rabobank District Zuid-Holland since April 2021. When this position crossed her path, she seized the opportunity with both hands. \"I always want to innovate. That is how I ended up here. I believe in continuous improvement. That is part of my mission: to make the world a bit better. Together, with colleagues, with members, with customers and with entrepreneurs in the region. As far as I'm concerned, that goes hand-in-hand.\"\n\nIn the beginnings\n\n\"My very first job at Rabobank was behind the counter in Werkendam. I came straight from secondary school and really started there. In those days, you arranged everything at the counter. For example, people came with their piggy banks to deposit money. I met many customers there; I learned something new every day. Why did I choose to work at Rabobank? I had always found economics interesting and I saw many opportunities in such a large organisation. I thought: I can build my career here. Judith laughs - in the meantime, she has moved on to more than fourteen positions: \"Yes, I have lived through the entire organisation! I like the different sides of the company.\"\n\nTo work for the same organisation for so long, the attraction must be strong. \" In the past, it seemed really dull to me: celebrating working somewhere for 25 years. But thanks to the many opportunities you get here, I have never found working for Rabobank boring. During my work and in the evenings, I always kept on learning and studying. Rabobank supported that. I also really like the bank's cooperative mission. I really enjoy working together and achieving things with others.\"\n\nThe way forward is together\n\n\"In my current position for example, I am responsible for the subject energy transition in my region. This is exactly the kind of subject that cannot be tackled in isolation. For instance, we help entrepreneurs put solar panels on their roofs. That is beneficial for the entrepreneurs and contributes to the energy transition in general. You have to bring people together to get real results. Listen to each other. I think that's the way forward. Certainly for a complex topic like energy transition, that is essential.\"\n\nJudith draws inspiration from Father van den Elsen, one of the founders of the boerenleenbank, the predecessor of the Rabobank. He said: 'A loner is a drowner'. \"I believe in the power of strengthening each other. I always try to connect people. Colleagues, clients, networks. For me, that is an attitude: being actively open to the ideas and wisdom of others. I often ask for advice. Two heads are better than one. And the best part is: this way you always meet new people and discover new things.\"\n\nDare to do what you want\n\nAfter several years at the bank, Judith made a radical choice. While she had the chance to become Director Private Clients, she chose to switch to Rabobank International. \"I was going to do a traineeship in a totally different part of the bank. Nothing was the same, except for the Rabobank logo on the letterhead. That was an exciting decision.\"\n\n\"By making this switch, I deliberately missed out on the opportunity to become Director for private clients. People thought I was crazy. Then I knew: this is the right choice. I like to do things differently. At the time, the traineeship suited my passion, qualities and ambition. I wanted to become Director for corporate clients. At the time, there were almost no women in that position, so it seemed like a good objective. And it worked! That was some time ago, but I still see such opportunities for development in this organisation. But you must seize these opportunities yourself. You have to want to improve and renew yourself all the time!\"","createdAt":1700840734,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"1f9afefa8da1","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"The way forward is together with colleagues, clients and entrepreneurs","image":{"_key":"31733381e0cc","_type":"image","alt":"Judith Cok - profiel","asset":{"_ref":"image-f992ee569872328cf445f38a539af5c4a0fc8e46-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["leadership","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"14a6797f-ce17-4260-8a8a-85ace03b16c4","title":"The auditor of the future: people-oriented and data-driven","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-auditor-of-the-future-people-oriented-and-data-driven"},"intro":"“The bank changes, and we auditors change with it. Not simply doing what is said, but taking the initiative yourself, making the difference yourself. We think it is important that our colleagues look for new ways to arrive at valuable findings.”","content":"\n\nRudi Kleijwegt has been Chief Audit at Rabobank since 2016. According to him, the auditor of the future is someone who uses innovative technologies and knows how to make an impact with them. “You can interpret data and transfer your findings to colleagues and management. Even if the message is less pleasant.”\n\nResearch culture and strategy in the organization\n\n“NextGen Audit is a program that prepares us for the future of our field. We take the next step in our technology, processes and methods, and people’s personal and professional development. We develop the most modern audit methods, such as process- and text mining. This enables us to make relevant observations about what is happening within the bank.”\n\n“Our auditors look at more than just data and processes. We also look at the behaviour of the people in our organization. For this, we use the Culture and Behavior framework. We use this to conduct research based on, among other things, questionnaires and interviews. Part of the research is how employees address each other. Both with compliments and with feedback. Our auditor of the future also looks closely at the organization’s strategy.”\n\nThe areas of expertise in Audit\n\n“We have four important domains within Rabobank. First of all, that is the Business domain. These include, for example, the bank’s activities in payment transactions, insurance, assets, customer service and financing. The second domain is KYC & Compliance. An important area for us here is that you audit all activities related to KYC and compliance, as well as HR and Legal. IT, Data & Innovation are the third domain. Here you focus on work related to technology, architecture and hardware. The fourth domain is Risk. You then work broadly in the field of credit, finance, models and general risk management.”\n\n\n\nA nice working environment\n\n“With Agile@Audit methodology, we put together our audit teams in an agile way. We have cross-functional teams that are responsible for their part of Rabobank. This decentralized way of working allows us to adapt to the rapidly changing world in and around the bank.”\n\n“I believe in the added value of a diversely composed audit team. We have colleagues with extensive work experience as auditors or accountants, such as RA or RE training. We also have colleagues from different backgrounds, such as sociology or philosophy. Many of our auditors have gained expertise in the company or the risk or compliance organization.”\n\n\"Within Rabobank, we work with the principles of Rabo@anywhere (https:\u002F\u002Frabobank.jobs\u002Fen\u002Fgrow-magazine\u002Fraboanywhere-the-new-way-of-working-after-corona\u002F). This means that we have great flexibility when working independently of time and place. We divide our workweek to work from home, from one of Rabobank’s central offices, and sometimes from a local office nearby.\"\n\nYou make the difference\n\n“We work at one of the largest audit departments in the Netherlands. That makes the work challenging, and the colleagues deliver high-quality work together. In combination with the pleasant working atmosphere, this makes it a truly unique workplace for me.”","createdAt":1702295681,"updatedAt":1702978827,"representation":{"_key":"4037f57a49f8","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Rudi Kleijwegt in gesprek met collega's","asset":{"_ref":"image-84f35be935cd2c28a81c03a2ba7a037ea6c03ce6-1920x1280-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"The auditor of the future: people-oriented and data-driven"},"skills":["change-agility","communication","compliance-reporting","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","operation-risk-management","professional-collaboration","regulatory-advice","risk-assessments","risk-strategies"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","social-innovation"],"vakgebied":"risk","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"b078510e-73c0-4066-8c8e-e06c8348a734","title":"Rabobank Traineeship: A 16-month journey to push your boundaries","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"rabobank-traineeship-a-16-month-journey-to-push-your-boundaries-federica-midi"},"intro":"Are you ready to break free from the conventional path and take your career to new heights?

The first two rotations are assigned to you. One in a familiar field or position, and the other in an area outside your expertise that you wish to explore. The final two rotations are chosen by you, giving you the opportunity to pursue your passions and interests. And if you're feeling adventurous, you even have the option to do a rotation abroad, depending on your preference. It's an exciting journey.”\n\n\n\nEmbrace the unknown\n\n“The program is designed to take you out of your comfort zone and introduce you to different areas of the bank,” Federica explains. Her first rotation was in IT, which was a stretch for her. “It didn’t fit my background at all! I got to work on the long-term strategy for the banking app, but I had no clue about information technology, platforms and how they work.” And that’s exactly the point, she explains. “It gets you out of your comfort zone, digging deep into complex things that you've never heard of before.”\n\n“My second rotation was more comfortable for me. It was in the team called Equity Capital Markets (ECM). This team helps other companies and organizations with their financial transactions involving stocks and shares. They do this by giving advice and helping with things like initial public offerings (IPOs), which is when a company first starts selling stocks to the public, and secondary offerings, which is when a company sells more stocks after the initial IPO. They also help with other types of financial transactions like convertible bonds and share buybacks, and use their knowledge of the market and financial information to create the best plan for each company they work with. I worked together with the juniors in the team on presentations for the clients, and with the seniors figuring out which content to highlight.”\n\n\n\nTaking ownership and getting support\n\n“In Italy, I used to work in a consulting role in finance, which gave me the experience to step up my game in this second rotation. Taking ownership of the projects you work on is important during the traineeship. I’ve noticed it’s part of the Rabobank culture: they expect you to be independent and as a trainee, you are the author of your development journey. You’re given the freedom to shape your career path, while you’re given the help and trust you need.”\n\n“As a trainee, you've got numerous people you can turn to,” Federica adds. This support network includes a personal mentor, a buddy who has gone through the program, talent managers and a supervisor in each team. “Additionally, you’re encouraged to reach out to people from all over the bank for information and advice.”\n\nNavigating a different culture\n\nWhat else did you learn? Federica jumps to answer the question. “It’s crucial that you express your issues, your concerns, and your propositions to the people you work with. I worked in countries and companies with a more hierarchical culture, in which it wasn’t easy to reach out to the head of a department or people with many years of experience. They wouldn’t easily make some time for you. In Rabobank, also very experienced professionals are happy to share their learnings, and wisdom with young professionals, and mentoring them. Networking is strongly encouraged.”\n\nAt the beginning of the traineeship, Federica found it difficult to approach a managing director or a head of a department directly. “This took a few trials to feel comfortable,\" she admits. “Before joining Rabobank, I thought that ‘juniors were juniors’. But now, I can confidently say, I dare to say my opinion, and I even challenge the views of people with more work experience,” she adds. “It's such a valuable learning point. I really enjoy working in an open and communicative work environment.”\n\n\n\nFun with an international crowd\n\nWorking with people from different cultural backgrounds is one of the most valuable aspects of the Rabobank Traineeship, according to Federica. “I enjoy working with people from different cultural backgrounds. I learn a lot from my Dutch colleagues, and there are other internationals here. I love seeing this more diverse side of the organization,” she shares.\n\n“I started my traineeship with 19 other trainees, and with many other young professionals who are following the same training programs. We've had awesome times together, doing sports activities such as beach volleyball tournaments, a trip to Schiermonnikoog and we visited Efteling theme park. You get to know different people throughout the bank because they organize drinks with different departments. We’re networking, asking questions and having fun at the same time. This makes connections between us much stronger, and it helps you to discover new things about yourself, too.”\n\n\n\nFocus on sustainability and innovation\n\nIt's a big day for Federica today as she starts a new rotation in the Sector Banking team, where she’ll be working on corporate finance within the food and agriculture sector. “I'm really excited about this opportunity,” she says. For Federica, joining the traineeship was about more than just learning about banking. It was also about finding a career that aligns with her values. “I was keen to work for an organization that is dedicated to sustainability and innovation,” she explains. “I truly believe that the financial industry has a crucial role to play in creating a better world. I'm proud to be a part of a bank that's at the forefront of this change.”","createdAt":1701080532,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"6681ee8cbfd6","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Rabobank Traineeship: A 16-month journey to push your boundaries","image":{"_key":"2e1efe0bd280","_type":"image","alt":"Young female professional is standing outside in front of Rabobank office","asset":{"_ref":"image-fedcd7a424685f7db97f0a56b5df3182c24fadf3-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":null,"language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"fb637cb9-4017-4c7b-9794-727f2562bc9a","title":"Product Manager Tertia bij FEC Tech: An open-minded perspective often leads to surprising questions that experts might overlook.”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"product-manager-fec-tech-tertia"},"intro":"Step into the world of Tertia. As a Product Manager in the FEC Tech division, she is a visionary force within the External Fraud Detection department. Her Fraud Expertise team grapples with the question: What needs to happen today to safeguard tomorrow’s customer against tomorrow’s fraudster?","content":"Tech, Data, and People\n\nSix years ago, Tertia became part of Rabobank. In all her roles, she operated at the intersection of technology, data, and human expertise. In 2022, she founded a new team and spent three months as a Product Manager for the team working on an advanced detection model. “It was a great opportunity for me to guide an additional team and contribute to the organization,” she reflects. Additionally, Tertia led the Product Owner Community, comprising of 600 Product Owners worldwide. She describes Rabobank as a promising environment: “There isn’t just one path to follow. Consider what you want and pursue it. There’s tremendous potential.”\n\n\n\nTertia’s team operates within Rabobank’s FEC (Financial Economic Crime) Tech domain, focusing on safeguarding both customers and the bank itself against criminals attempting to siphon money through various means. For instance, they tackle Bank Helpdesk fraud. To shield customers from such fraudsters, the department employs sophisticated detection systems. They analyze additional data streams both within and outside the bank to continually enhance their systems, ensuring resilience against emerging forms of fraud.\n\n\n\nA Fresh Perspective\n\nEquipped with the right resources, people, and tools, Tertia ensures her team members can perform their roles optimally. Whenever possible, she simplifies workflows. “Simplification is a central theme within the bank and my role.” Despite the complexity of their work, Tertia always strives to make it as straightforward as possible for both customers and the team. “I eliminate any noise or unnecessary steps in the workflow.\"\n\n\n\nHuman vs. technology\n\nAutomation also plays a role in simplification. Tertia isn’t afraid that technology will completely take over all the work. “People will always be necessary for certain complex tasks and for the ethical aspect of decision-making. What’s exciting is that automation handles repetitive tasks, leaving the complex work for humans.”\n\nAdditionally, Tertia explains: “this ensures that we have the best people at Rabobank—driven experts capable of solving the most complex problems.” The team’s challenges always require diverse expertise. Tertia emphasizes, “It’s not the work of a single expert; collaboration across multiple disciplines allows us to solve these problems by considering various angles.\n\n\nThinking Differently\n\nTertia’s drive lies in bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, ideas, and opinions. Above all, she encourages different ways of thinking. “Every quarter, we plan and assess the expertise needed for the tasks at hand. Sometimes, we intentionally add someone with a different skill set. An open-minded perspective often leads to surprising questions that experts might overlook.”\n\nTertia draws inspiration from external sources. “In my team, conversations can go in any direction. A chat that starts with the universe, music, or chess might unexpectedly yield ideas for our work.” Such an open atmosphere thrives in a safe environment.Tertia explains that “psychological safety is crucial, and we measure it quarterly within the bank using the Engagement Scan. I’m proud to say we score high in this area!”\n\n\n\nWork on yourself and shape the world around you\n\nTertia feels at home at Rabobank—a place where she can grow and where diverse individuals come together to contribute to a societal purpose. “I appreciate the speed and dynamism of the business world, but the connection to society is essential for me. The bank’s cooperative mission is evident in our people, projects, and work. It’s clear: in this role, where you protect customers from payment fraud, you’re right in the heart of society.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711722010,"updatedAt":1714124174,"representation":{"_key":"fe226fdb5143","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Tertia","asset":{"_ref":"image-0bd1e83a0a31dce34e34a5ff04793d58d5a9f48d-6580x4387-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.941780711442393,"width":0.34484737866545345,"x":0.6220069780741649,"y":0.5291096442788035}},"label":"article","title":"Product Manager Tertia bij FEC Tech: An open-minded perspective often leads to surprising questions that experts might overlook.”"},"skills":["business-networking","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","cross-functional-teamwork","data-insights","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","performance-management-pm","product-development","professional-collaboration","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-culture","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"0b5d8e51-8c58-4c89-bb83-026e0f3e79aa","title":"How we bring structure to the IT landscape","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"together-we-bring-structure-to-the-it-landscape"},"intro":"From strategy to implementation: that’s the task of a Business Architect. Marja Klijn prefers to work on that task with a whiteboard close at hand. “You need pictures to explain certain concepts and bring people into your story. But I’m not an artist. Circles and triangles are often enough for me.”","content":"Not everyone is familiar with the role of Business Architect, Marja says. “For people who really can’t imagine the profession, I conveniently compare it to a landscape architect. My landscape is a complex organization. And it’s not about buildings, roads and parks, but about structures, IT systems and services. Those are all connected too, and we have to organize everything well.”\n\nBalance between the bigger picture and detail\n\nWhen she wants to explain something, Marja looks for an appropriate image. Like Rabobank’s organizational structure, which she illustrates using triangles. “In a management triangle there is a business manager, an architect and an IT lead. The business manager specifies the requirements, and as an architect you figure out how best to fulfill them. The IT lead looks for the right people with whom to accomplish the workload and at what cost. These three continuously challenge each other in order to achieve the best results together. Can it be even simpler, more effective?”\n\n“Suppose the business wants to add an IT service. We then discuss exactly what needs to be done and what the impact will be on our information flows. How do we tackle it, which people do we need for this? To determine the best direction, I need to know the underlying reason. Sometimes in a conversation I’ll ask ‘why?’ five times.”\n\n“A management triangle like that exists at different levels. It starts with the overarching tribes, then areas and then squads. More and more we zoom in a little further and specific details become more important. As an architect, you need to know the nitty-gritty, but you also need to maintain a helicopter view. That balance is very important.”\n\nBusiness Architect visualizes the dot on the horizon\n\nWhat skills are indispensable as a Business Architect? Marja: “Analytical ability and good communication skills. Analytical skills to think conceptually and strike a balance between details and the bigger picture. Communication skills to take all parties along in the right direction. We usually start with a PSA: project starting architecture. In this document, we highlight the impact of a new decision on our application landscape from different angles.”\n\n“While a PSA is the guide for elaborating the architecture, it above all helps people get onboard in an accessible way. Not everyone knows their way around the application landscape, so a clear explanation is essential. Visualizing it in an architectural drawing helps. The same goes for myself, by the way. When I need to think something through, I prefer to sit in a room with colleagues surrounded by whiteboards. Drawing, thinking aloud and constructing solutions together. Those are the most fun meetings.”\n\n“My challenge is setting the dot on the horizon and figuring out how we’re going to get there in the foreseeable future,” Marja says. “All while meeting the needs and requirements of the business in an efficient and cost-effective manner. I’m results-oriented: if there’s a deadline, we roll up our sleeves and set to work. That fit with the Simplify@Scale way of working that we have at the bank. Because we work in sprints, you always have a clear goal in mind.”\n\nNo hairball\n\nWhen asked what would go wrong if there were no Business Architects, Marja responds firmly. “Architecture contributes to a structured IT landscape. Do you know what a hairball is? The mess that comes from constantly adding something to a system without looking at the bigger picture. The architect takes a step back and looks at the context. This is how we ensure that the system remains agile. If you keep tying everything together, it all unravels so much faster when something changes.”\n\nFinding the right place\n\n“I work as a Tribe Architect for the Credit Core Tribe, where we deal with all the policies regarding the risks we face within the bank when we finance a client, for example. Within the Tribe, I additionally fulfill a role as Area Architect for the Earth area. The combination of the more managing role of Tribe Architect and a more substantive role as Area Architect makes it challenging for me.”\n\n“After my previous position as a Business Architect, I was looking for something new. I wanted to do more with my personal interests in agriculture, nature and climate; I grew up as a horticulturist’s daughter and studied at the agricultural university. I wanted to explore whether I could do more with my background. Rabobank gave me the space to figure it out. During a sabbatical, I started talking to people inside and outside the bank. This is how I found out that I didn’t want to completely change course, but could instead apply my accumulated knowledge as a Business Architect to the topics that interested me. In a large organization like this, it’s just a matter of finding the right place.”\n\n“The fact that I was given the space for this search makes Rabobank a great employer for me. I feel very comfortable here. It’s the combination of my position and working with people who are open and approachable. It’s just nice working together; I never felt like I had been thrown into the deep end. Everyone is willing to help you get started, which is the reason why we do things together. That’s what makes me thrive here.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1701871946,"updatedAt":1705055245,"representation":{"_key":"c19f661f5cf5","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"How we bring structure to the IT landscape","image":{"_key":"c36d2870dfde","_type":"image","alt":"Marja Klijn in front of the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-b85a89f3735d8a8a9c0cb16f8397f8e73cecdb35-2560x1707-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":[],"proofPoints":["personal-development"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"7d494a41-e3d3-4984-8e85-56cb806ad7e4","title":"Making numbers come alive with storytelling","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-as-a-business-controller"},"intro":"How do you tell the story behind the numbers? Kiki Ruedisueli spoke enthusiastically about her work and the role that robots and storytelling play in it.","content":"“What does a Business Controller Operations do? We act as sparring partners and trusted advisers for the departments we are responsible for—in my case, that is Operations. As Business Controller, I report to the management team on figures and budgets. I like to say that we are “the financial conscience.” This means that in the work we do and the advice we give, we are always mindful of the fact that it must contribute to the ambition of being a healthy bank. In addition, I find it important that the insights I share fit within the scope, strategy, and ambitions of Rabobank without losing sight of the people behind it.”\n\nFrom junior to management team\n\n“I started at Rabobank in a temp role and was then hired as a Business Controller. I've been doing that for about three and a half years now, but I've had so many opportunities and developed so much that it feels like I've had several jobs. In this role, it's important to understand how the organization works, what we do for our customers, and how we can strengthen each other within Rabobank. I see Operations as the “purring engine” of Rabobank. The department employs around 4,000 people who work directly for the benefit of our customers every day. What we do here matters to the outside world. The figures we calculate have an impact on society.”\n\n“From a junior position focused on general processes and reporting, I progressed to coordinating work such as the multi-year budget (midterm planning) and then became a trusted advisor to the management team. Every month, I present figures and insights to the management team, which bases its decisions on them. We discuss Rabobank’s budgets, future budgets, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Based on the figures, I explain the actions we can take. What I like is how Operations sees their Business Controllers as full MT members. You slot into the management team’s routine, joining them for everything from regular meetings to annual plans.”\n\n\n\nRobots enable storytelling\n\nWithin Operations, Kiki works for the Payments Department and, since recently, the Robotics Wealth Building and Insurance Department (RVV). Kiki: “They are not robots like in the movies, but solutions for automating processes, ranging from automatically sorting activities by priority to the automatic preparation of files. It is so wonderful to see how much value this creates across the bank. The other day, my fellow Business Controllers and I were brainstorming about the potential of robots in our profession. Which processes can we outsource? How can we get insights quickly? A lot of time goes into producing reports even though it would be more valuable to spend that time analyzing and advising.”\n\n“The way you explain figures is so important. I focus on the story behind the figures, that's where my role adds value: storytelling. It’s a skill that is becoming increasingly important, alongside skills such as complex problem-solving and analytical skills. Storytelling brings to life the story behind a hard number. As Business Controllers, we move from numbers to consultancy. We also call this a move from Chief Finance Officer to Chief Value Officer. This is why I think storytelling is an incredibly important skill to keep developing.”\n\nPersonal development\n\nRabobank offers all kinds of opportunities for personal and professional development. As an employee, you can arrange your own development path and your career, for example with the personal development budget. Kiki: “My manager and I look at which areas I want to develop further in. What appeals to me, what do I still want to learn, where can I contribute? I am very eager to learn and enjoy acquiring new knowledge. For instance, I attend seminars on leadership or knowledge sessions. But I also like talking to people on the floor about how they do their work. Another option is to temporarily join another department. I got to work at Investor Relations for six months on the publication of the annual figures. That was incredibly valuable for my development. The culture is open, everyone is always willing to brainstorm with you or explain something.”\n\nRecovery time does not appear to be a word in Kiki's dictionary. “That’s true! But, because we work hybrid at Rabobank, I have the freedom to have a flexible schedule. After an intensive session, I love to go for a long walk in the woods with my dogs just to clear my head and let everything sink in. When I get back, I return to work fresh. I am 110% committed to our customers and my colleagues. I believe that by doing your job well, by really going that extra mile, you make the world a better place.”\n\nWhen asked where she will be in five years, Kiki replied, “I find that an incredibly difficult question. I have broad interests and the opportunities within the bank are endless, so I'm sure the next one will present itself. And in the words of Pippi Longstocking, “I've never tried that before, so I think I definitely should be able to do that.” Perhaps I’ll go see what’s happening around IT or make a parallel step to another position. As far as I'm concerned, growth can be both horizontal and vertical. My path is not yet finished at Rabobank, I am 100% sure of that.”","createdAt":1701878319,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"d52b8037e46c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Making numbers come alive with storytelling","image":{"_key":"8a47fe4e2552","_type":"image","alt":"Woman in blue suit (Business Controller) standing at glass wall.","asset":{"_ref":"image-ba40b400df8918a092d47e2b68dd185867750319-1613x1075-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-acumen","business-process-improvements","business-reporting","change-agility","customer-focused","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","storytelling","data-insights","risk-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"finance-risk","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"c78718c9-588a-4137-8845-8df4d4db017d","title":"Credit Risk Modeller Ying: the added value of risk modelling in the renewable energy industry","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"credit-risk-modeller-ying-the-added-value-of-risk-modelling-in-the-renewable-energy-industry"},"intro":"Ying Yao, Senior Credit Risk Modeller at Rabobank, has found her calling in the renewable energy space. Drawing on her passion for environmental science, she now leverages forward-looking models to solve complex problems in the wind and solar industries. With a clear focus on professional development and a business-driven mindset, Ying is thriving in her role at Rabobank. How does she combine creative thinking and complex problem-solving in her work? How does her team work together to move new wind- and solar initiatives forward?","content":"Creativity in Risk Modelling\n\nYing started her career at Rabobank in 2017 as an intern, and her skills in quantitative finance helped her to become a Quantitative Risk Analyst focusing on pricing methodologies. Eventually, the position of Senior Credit Risk Modeller caught her attention due to its combination of problem-solving and creativity in a simulation-based model development.\n\nFuture-oriented\n\nYing and her team develop risk models tailored to Rabobank’s project finance portfolio, focussing on the renewable energy market. Ying: “The bank sees great strategic importance in the energy transition, which makes my contributions even more valuable. Our financial models play an important role in offering clients better pricing options and to help in risk differentiation. While risk and finance may seem traditional, the modellers who work in renewable energy require a creative skill set.”\n\nYing explains why: “Traditionally, risk models rely on historical data, analyzing factors like balance sheets, assets, collaterals, and portfolios. However, in the field of renewable energy, we apply a more forward-looking approach.” Ying explains the shift: “Instead of focusing on past performance, we predict future cash flows and assess the costs and benefits of a project.”\n\nThis forward-looking perspective introduces new uncertainties and unknowns. “Creating models based on thousands of possible scenarios demands a fresh outlook and the ability to think creatively. “Next to these new ways of thinking, it is also our responsibility to incorporate functional business requirements into these models, and meanwhile not overcomplicating the model too much and meeting external deadline. It is a challenge to make it all happen!”\n\nValuable Insights\n\nWithin the field of risk modelling, collaboration is inevitable. Ying explains how the team dynamic works. “The consultants in our team contribute valuable business insights to the team, translate requirements from business stakeholders and help evaluate modelling results and process with regulatory requirements. Our junior modellers focus more on analyses, coding and methodology. They make sure all models and features are efficiently and accurately implemented. As a medior and senior modeller, you play a more significant role in communicating with our stakeholders. You are responsible for the outcome of the model, and you really need to convey clearly all the objectives, expectations, and deliverables to different stakeholders.”\n\n\n\nDeveloping Professional Skills\n\nYing recently completed an agile training course. “With the adoption of Simplify@Scale, we’ve seen significant organizational changes. Embracing agility has become imperative. At Rabobank, you get a personal development budget, with which you can shape your own development for example by choice a training or course of your liking. I can enrol in courses and seamlessly integrate them into my work schedule. Additionally, we receive annual study hours dedicated to self-improvement, which you can use during working hours.” Can you also improve your technical skills? “Absolutely! You can enhance your Python skills, master PowerBI, delve into dashboarding, and even follow customized courses on data analytics. There’s an extensive selection of courses available, whether you’re a beginner or already on an intermediate level. The learning possibilities are endless!”\n\n“At Rabobank, we foster a culture of exploration and knowledge-sharing. We constantly seek to stay ahead with the latest advancements in machine learning and AI. How can we embrace these cutting-edge technologies while adhering to our regulatory obligations? These are very fascinating and exciting topics to me. There is so much happening in our area of expertise. Even though we can build larger models with AI and enhanced computing power, it remains crucial to be able to articulate the outcomes of these models to our clients and stakeholders. It’s a responsibility I deeply understand and value.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1701873511,"updatedAt":1703004974,"representation":{"_key":"1ec796f76415","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"title":"The added value of risk modelling in the renewable energy industry","label":"article","image":{"_key":"8ed6de297b71","_type":"image","alt":"Young women in office garden","asset":{"_ref":"image-8d0090574f723c5b780d0cfc8ab30a7607a9b63b-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["transitions","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"db5c1dfe-9c5d-42a7-b146-39526f27a4f6","title":"Do what you love and you'll do better","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"do-what-you-love-and-you-will-do-better-yaseir-alkhwalda"},"intro":"When Yaseir Alkhwalda arrived in the Netherlands in 2017 he felt he got a new chance to pursue his passion. As an English teacher in Syria he never got the chance to work with computers the way he wanted to. Once here in the Netherlands he enrolled in a program at Hack Your Future to learn web development. After that, he landed in his current job as a Junior Systems Engineer at Rabobank, maintaining one of the most crucial systems of the bank.","content":"“I arrived in the Netherlands after a three month-long journey through five countries and over the sea. Due to the Syrian crisis I had to leave my country. After a few months in Amsterdam I started a volunteer job as a computer teacher for kids at Cybersoek, an organisation helping people with computers.”\n\nHack your Future\n\n“Around the same time, I started at Hack Your Future as well. This is a school that teaches computer programming to refugees. In six months I learned the fundamentals of web development. They taught us how to think like a programmer, how to solve problems, how to manage a project. They also help refugees find a job.”\n\nI took the opportunity in the Netherlands to study IT, which I loved when I was young. In Syria I was also working with IT, more as a hobby. It was a big turning point in my life that changed everything. I believe when you do things you love, you will do them better. Love what you’re doing is so important to move on in life.”\n\n“Hack Your Future helped me find my first job, an internship for three months at Ticketing Group in Amsterdam. For me it was great to have a job after a year of arriving in the Netherlands. It gave me more energy to think about my life and to move forward. To me, being human is to be active. I don’t like to sit at home waiting for a job to come, you have to move forward yourself.”\n\nYoung Professional Program\n\n“When I walked around in Amsterdam I noticed Rabobank everywhere. I saw the offices, the advertising. Because I wanted to have a job to move forward, I decided to visit the website of Rabobank to see what’s possible. I read interviews with Rabobank employees and I read about the Young Professional Program. So even before I started my internship, I applied for the Young Professional Program IT (YPP IT) at Rabobank. when I started the internship, I got a call from one of the IT recruiters at the bank. I got through the first selection! After three additional interviews, I was selected to start in the YPP IT. The program started when my internship ended so this was a great next step for me.”\n\n“I am still in the YPP IT and I am working with my team on the mainframe computers of Rabobank. These are the systems that connect various crucial systems of the bank to each other. We have to make sure everything stays up and running. When something goes wrong, we can’t just turn it off and on again like you would do with your laptop. This mainframe is one of the vital systems of the bank. We have to maintain the machines and make sure everything keeps running smoothly. This is important for our internal processes and for the service to our customers.”\n\nFresh start\n\n“I had a fresh start in the Netherlands, with my wife and baby. Rabobank provided me with the opportunity to do something different and they believe in me. My mentor helps me to make me feel confident in my job, the team and outside the bank.

In short, the data scientists come up with the models and the data engineers in the Data Fundaments & Model Operations team make sure they are fed with well-structured data. We also ensure that the models in production operate stably. ”\n\n\"Our models help other departments within the bank do their jobs. I work primarily on models that try to detect financial crime, such as the Source of Funds model. The model looks at the money coming in over a period of time. How much growth is there, how fast was it? There are really a lot of variables that we factor in. If something catches our eye, someone suddenly transferring large sums of money, we automatically forward that to a team of analysts who further investigate what exactly is going on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking raw data usable for models\n\n\"At the bank, you have access to a lot of raw data from different sources: from customers, accounts, organizations, industries, and so on. As a data engineer, you structure that data with the prerequisites of the data scientists. We work closely together, because you have to coordinate this well. We combine the data into a useful set for the model.\"\n\n\"In addition, we make sure the models keep running well in practice. You set up the production environment and test extensively to make sure everything is working properly. Is the model functioning as expected, is all the data available, is the output correct? We do this together with the platform teams, they maintain the servers on which the model runs. Once a model is in production, we continuously monitor how it's doing and fix problems as they arise.\"\n\n\"Right now I am working on migrating our models to Azure, Microsoft's cloud environment. This is quite a challenge for our department. Because we want to make sure everything keeps working well, we now run our systems in parallel on our own systems as well as in the cloud.\"\n\n\n\nGaining and sharing knowledge\n\n\"I like to work on long-term projects. Then I can get all caught up in it. That's why I love working at a bank. I have the space to focus on one subject so that I can grow and learn in it. And what remains really cool is that huge amount of data you can work with. A gold mine! You can develop so many services with it. We create models that personalize the Rabo App or help categorize expenses.\"\n\n\"What you learn, you also share with each other. Once a month, the entire Area Data Science meets to share knowledge. Anyone who wants to share something or have a discussion on a particular topic can do so. You can talk about your own project, or discuss a new package or library. It is completely free to fill in. I gave a session myself on new customer data-based datasets, what's in there and how to use it within different projects.\"\n\n\n\nWork that matters\n\n“You don’t notice at all that you work at a bank. Today’s banks are actually very large IT companies with a banking license in which data plays an increasingly important role. I have yet to encounter the stereotypical banker in jacket-tie in my department. When I just started here, I did always put on a dress shirt, or something quite formal,” Michel laughs now. “Until I saw my manager walking around in Air Max and a T-shirt. The atmosphere is very relaxed and everyone is open to questions from each other.”\n\n“All in all, I feel like I’m really making an impact here. Not only for the bank, but also for society. I worked on use cases focused on marketing in a previous job as a data engineer, but that commercial angle did not suit me as well. The work I do now plays out in the community. I think it is important to contribute to countering financial crime, such as money laundering. I feel I can really make a difference to society and that gives me great satisfaction.”","createdAt":1700558883,"updatedAt":1702978827,"representation":{"_key":"7f2e43965a8e","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Contributing to society with data","image":{"_key":"f542d00bb4cf","_type":"image","alt":"Man in front of stairs","asset":{"_ref":"image-1103ca0796d395033294027bc1a5822da48e575d-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"561bd790-1631-43f7-84cb-6b7aaa92bb6a","title":"From turntables to dashboards: the work of Business Architect Nik at Rabobank FECtech.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"business-architect-fec-tech-nik"},"intro":"Nik Terbruggen, formerly a music producer, exchanged his turntables for a desk at Rabobank. As a Business Architect within FEC (Financial Economic Crime) Tech, he is constructing a digital working environment that all FEC analysts are using. His goal? To ensure that this environment remains solid and adaptable not only now, but also in the future.","content":"Business Architect at FEC Tech\n\nThe work of a Business Architect is akin to that of a traditional architect, Nik explains. “Before anything is built, I think like an architect about what it needs to fulfil. How can I ensure that this working environment remains rock-solid ten years from now, while also allowing for expansion with new technologies?”\n\n\n\nMusic of the future\n\n“We’re working towards a shared environment where all analysts can seamlessly collaborate.” This environment is designed to streamline individual work processes and enhance cooperation among different teams. “FEC has grown significantly, resulting in various isolated ‘islands.’ My task, with the help of this platform, is to ensure that these ‘islands’ move harmoniously. Beyond improved collaboration, this work environment also enables us to easily exchange technical components.”\n\n\n\n\nGatekeeper Role\n\nThe work environment is being built using Pega technology, Nik explains. He’s referring to Pega Platform, a leading provider of software for business process management. Nik even flew to the headquarters in Boston last year to collaborate with fellow architects on improvements.\n\nSuch a work environment is not only beneficial for Rabobank but also for organizations worldwide. “So many companies are fighting financial crime—we fulfil that gatekeeper role together.” Fortunately, they connect with each other at events such as the Leaders in Finance AML (Anti Money Laundering) conference,. A conference where “seventy different organizations were present—banks, as well as institutions like the DNB, the FIU, and law enforcement—to discuss shared responsibility in this field.”\n\n\nTrust Relationship\n\nAs a Business Architect, Nik serves as a connecting link. He carefully considers feedback from analysts and input from management, incorporating all perspectives into the development of the work environment. Change management is also a crucial aspect of his role. Nik understands that while you can devise the perfect technological solution, it must also be understood. For this, more than just logical arguments are necessary; you need to build a trust relationship\n\n\nSocial Impact\n\nIt’s clear that Nik is happy with his move to become a Business Architect. “The most exciting aspect of this work is the opportunity for greenfield thinking. Rather than dwelling on today’s obstacles, we focus on what’s possible in the future.”\n\nFor Nik, who previously expressed his creativity through music, this approach feels like a familiar melody. “Just like in music, starting from a blank canvas, I can channel my creativity here as a business architect exploring all the possibilities. It means letting go of everything and asking myself: How would we shape this in an ideal world?”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711722353,"updatedAt":1714124140,"representation":{"_key":"89d49f494d78","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Nik","asset":{"_ref":"image-1e02e5c8ab1a34291a7d0115b91732af6411d69f-7008x4672-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.9001889144669607,"width":0.40967716582833913,"x":0.4529922694376069,"y":0.49662186893590404}},"label":"article","title":"From turntables to dashboards: the work of Business Architect Nik at Rabobank FECtech."},"skills":["business-networking","business-process-improvements","change-agility","data-insights","solution-architecture"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"53dbabd1-bc2d-41e4-aef0-efeef421bbd9","title":"Product Manager Martijn:“You don’t have to be an IT whiz kid to be successful within FEC Tech”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"product-manager-martijn-you-don-t-have-to-be-an-it-whiz-kid"},"intro":"Product Manager Martijn Jansen found his place within FEC (Financial Economic Crime) Tech. He frequently experiences the urgent need to combat financial crime. In just two years, he and his team developed a new dashboard for analysts that remains in continuous development. As Martijn puts it: “Staying still is not an option.”","content":"The developments within the FEC domain are expanding, leading to an increased workload. “The field demands speed and efficiency,” says Martijn. \"The dashboard focuses on today’s process design and workflow. Simultaneously, we contemplate the future way of working. This necessitates a scalable and flexible dashboard that adapts to changing needs. That’s what makes the work so dynamic!\".\n\nAnalyst Dashboard\n\nMartijn’s role centers around the FEC Analyst Dashboard, a tool used by over 3,000 colleagues. “The fascinating aspect is that we work on something very concrete. It’s like a cockpit that allows an FEC analyst to delve into customer details. Based on what happens there, an analyst decides whether action is required. What makes my work interesting is that we built this application from scratch. Two years ago, it was a blank canvas.”\n\nThe FEC Analyst Dashboard continues to evolve. \"Currently, analysts work with various systems, spending too much time gathering information. Our challenge is to achieve seamless integration with the workflow application, guiding analysts step by step and providing integrated customer information when needed”.\n\n\n\nNot an IT whizzkid\n\nDespite Martijn’s complete comfort within FEC Tech, his background lies in Accountancy. He initially worked as a public accountant, where he became acquainted with the relevance of IT. He advised different companies on strengthening their internal organizations. “You don’t need to be an IT whiz to succeed in FEC,” he emphasizes. However, certain skills are crucial: “Being able to distinguish between essentials and details, flexibility, result-oriented thinking, and generating fresh ideas. Additionally, bridging the gap between business and IT requires effective collaboration and communication.” Martijn ensures that the dashboard is currently well-utilized by analysts while keeping a keen eye on the future.\n\n\nHuman knowledge\n\nWhile Martijn’s role centers around a product—the dashboard—he is primarily focused on the people. As a committed team player, he emphasizes ownership and individual responsibility. Making mistakes is allowed; it’s an opportunity to learn. Continuously working to make a difference for the customer is also part of the job. When a project stalls, Martijn consciously takes time for his team. Randomly shouting something doesn’t make sense. Instead, he asks targeted questions: Where should we go? Does everyone understand the direction we need to take? Sometimes, individual conversations help uncover bottlenecks.\n\n\n\n\nNot Tomorrow, But Today\n\nMartijn reiterates: “Don’t be discouraged because you think you lack knowledge of innovation or the latest developments in the IT field. As long as you’re curious and have an affinity for innovation and data.” Various courses helped Martijn gain expertise in the field and understand the agile way of working. \"You can learn so much in a short time; Rabobank offers various opportunities. As long as you have the desire to adapt and take on challenges, you’ll find yourself in a great place here.\"\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711456101,"updatedAt":1714124275,"representation":{"_key":"6045c8ec82f1","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Martijn","asset":{"_ref":"image-cd35ef0268338d809174e100e9181e81cb3ed7cd-7008x4672-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":1,"width":0.5654556065389554,"x":0.35330012073255573,"y":0.5}},"label":"article","title":"Product Manager Martijn:“You don’t have to be an IT whiz kid to be successful within FEC Tech”"},"skills":["business-strategies","coaching","communication","customer-due-diligence-cdd","data-insights","project-coordination"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"traineeship","id":"db4808f0-3503-4f33-b594-ca99cfa1bd85","title":"Advanced Analytics","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"advanced-analytics"},"intro":"Would you rather work on solutions than problems?\n\nThis makes the Advanced Analytics Program the perfect opportunity for you to apply and develop your analytical skills.

To redevelop the model for the international wholesale portfolio as a credit risk modeller is as complex as it is valuable. Senior Credit Risk Modeller Martin van Buren prefers to bite down on the most complicated quantitative issues and likes to talk about it.","content":"Risk analysis: a responsible task\n\n‘Risk is inherent in banking, because any loan has a chance of not being fully paid back. From mortgages to large corporate loans, for every loan portfolio in the bank there is a credit model that helps us manage the risks . Our team is working on the redevelopment of the PD-model of the international wholesale portfolio. To this end, we perform quantitative analyses on immense amounts of data to map out the creditworthiness of customers.’\n\n‘Our credit models are the basis for decision-making. That is quite a responsibility, especially when it comes to the international wholesale portfolio. Our clients range from Dutch SMEs to the listed corporates we all recognize from the economics section of the newspaper. In terms of credit risk capital, this is Rabobank’s largest portfolio.’\n\n‘So in terms of exposure, it’s billions – but the social impact is also huge. Many companies depend on our model. As one of the largest financial institutions in the Netherlands, Rabobank bears joint responsibility for a healthy financial climate. That pressure is palpable, both from the business and the ECB, but it is definitely motivating. We know very well what we are contributing to.’\n\nThe redevelopment of redevelopments\n\n‘Modelling is always a cyclical process, but the cycle we are now in is of unprecedented proportions. I have been working for Rabobank since 2007 and have never done a project as extensive as the redevelopment of this model. The data landscape is vast, the diversity of clients is enormous, the standards we have to meet are sky-high, regulations are – rightly – increasingly stringent and we have to deal with many different stakeholders and interests.’\n\n‘A model is a simplified representation of reality. But that reality is a rather complex whole that is constantly changing, so that is our greatest challenge. “Keep it simple, stupid”, is what I always say. And if we can find the right balance between that transparent simplicity and that complex reality, we really make a difference. For a credit risk modeller, this is the moment where you can write history: this redevelopment of the model. There is a lot at stake.’\n\nThe human side of a technical profession\n\n‘In my team, that pressure creates an extra drive to perfect the model. I manage a team of 10 modellers. They program, mainly in Python, to perform the analyses to identify and quantify risks. I am the bridge between them, the management and other stakeholders. Such as the business, i.e. the people who use the models, but also IT for the implementation, the data team for the quality of the data, the validation team and audit. The latter two monitor the model content and process.’\n\n‘Personally, I find the network of stakeholders a very nice aspect of this profession. Risk analytics sounds quite technical, and in the core it is, but it is also very human. The complexity lies, on the one hand, in the quantitative puzzle itself and, on the other hand, in the interpretations and the various interests it represents. In the end, we all serve the client. And yes, we use advanced Python scripts, but we must always be able to explain it to everyone, including non-technical stakeholders. Whether it is senior management, the business or the regulator, the model must be as transparent and understandable as possible.’\n\nTogether for the best result\n\n‘I am incredibly proud of my team. The pressure is high, the dynamics matchless and the atmosphere is good! We are a very close team of very smart people from all over the world and we work very closely together. So, many stand-ups, round-table discussions and knowledge sharing meetings. We are critical and keep each other on our toes. Normally, we do a lot of fun things besides work. Covid has made that a little less, but we still have a lot of fun together.’\n\n‘That atmosphere contributes to everyone’s dedication to making this project a success. We did not miss a deadline, I am really proud of that. Everyone helps each other, within the team but also outside. This mentality is typical of Rabobank: we always make time for others, no matter how busy we are. There is a great awareness that you get the best results together, especially within risk analytics.
