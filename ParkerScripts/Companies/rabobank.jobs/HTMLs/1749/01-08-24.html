in the bank, rolling it out across the country, and spreading your enthusiasm to your colleagues. And even discovering your entrepreneurial side that bit later in life. That’s how Rob Haane, Mobile Banking Adviser, Retail Banking, works to improve himself and the world around him.","content":"In 2017 Rob started the Mobile Banking at Home service in Zuid-Limburg. The service is meant for customers for whom visiting a bank office \u002F is a complex business. A person working for the Everyday Banking department visits those people at home to offer them practical support with their finances. Rob: “This allows us to remain close to clients even in a rapidly changing digital world.” The aim is to make clients more self-reliant when it comes to their finances.\n\nWas it exciting to set up something new?\n\n“Yes! I discovered my inner entrepreneur,” says Rob, “I’d worked at Rabobank since 1986. And suddenly I got the opportunity to build a new service from scratch all on my own. Of course, I had help from colleagues working nearby and around the country, but I set most of it up myself. That shows how much the bank trusts you. I had a lot to do from the start: talking to colleagues, organizing mobile phones, and raising awareness through a local media campaign. I did all of that. Talk about exciting!”\n\nAcross the country, we have over 250 advisers who visit our clients at home to help them do their banking. It’s one of the tasks of colleagues working at Everyday Banking. Rob: “You have several roles when you work at Everyday Banking. You welcome customers coming into a physical bank location, you give advice over the phone, and you have time to visit people at home to provide the Mobile Banking at Home service.”\n\nHelping one in six people in the Netherlands\n\nThe Mobile Banking at Home service gave Rob the opportunity to experience how to launch a new service in the bank. “You’re given the freedom to organize things your own way. The words ‘can’t do’ are not in my vocabulary!” Let me give you an example: sometimes you need to print something for the customer at their home. So I looked for a way to provide our advisers with secure mobile printers to get the job done. It’s all about not giving up till you find a solution, which helps to continuously improve the service.”\n\nIt’s that autonomy, that network in the regions and his own entrepreneurial spirit that have got Rob where he is now and ensured that the Mobile Banking at Home service is still expanding. Rob: “One in six people in the Netherlands finds it hard to do online banking and deal with digitalization. As a bank we want to stay in contact with these people. That’s what motivated me to create the Mobile Bankservice. When you sit drinking tea with someone at their kitchen table, you realize you really are helping them. It’s such satisfying work and they can’t thank you enough. Our clients feel reassured because colleagues who know what they’re doing go out to help them in their trusted home environment.”\n\nFrom the living room to the village square\n\nRob describes the benefits of the service: “It literally reduces the distance between the bank and its customers and brings back the human touch. I think that’s so important. This service ensures that everyone can use Rabobank’s banking services. Even those people who can’t get into an office or who are not very savvy when it comes to using the app or mobile banking.”\n\nThen Rob went the extra mile and introduced a camper which takes a mobile office to the heart of villages and to service points. “I was picking up signs that people in my region thought our offices were too far away. So we set up a new project, bought a camper, and converted it to an office. Here too, we focus on what’s possible and how we can provide the best customer experience from the options available.” The Mobile Banking at Home camper branch is open every week in Gulpen (Limburg) and is a great success.\n\nPersonal Development\n\n“It’s fantastic that I can help people become more financially self-reliant. The opportunities Rabobank offers me to do this are amazing. My most important mission is to expand the mobile advice service even further.” \n\nRob also puts his experience to work to support young co-workers in their development. “I’m not an official coach or mentor. I just help people on the work floor, when they need it. I’ve learned a lot at the bank and my experience lets me help other colleagues.”\n\nRob mentions two specific moments which really made the difference during his long career. When he worked for Rabobank as a mortgage adviser, he realized that the almost constant paperwork was making him miserable. “What I do best is talking to people and giving one-to-one advice. That’s what makes me tick.”\n\nThis realization made him determined to switch to a job at Everyday Banking, where he later encountered the Mobile Banking at Home service. “Looking back, it was my best decision ever. Of course, change can be scary, but you should be open to it. You’re never too old to take your career in a completely different direction. For me, each day that I can give people advice is a gift. My job feels like a handmade suit that’s a perfect fit.”\n\n","createdAt":1701702927,"updatedAt":1702990526,"representation":{"_key":"048c6f6da14c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Rob Haane staat voor de bus van de Mobiele Bankservice.","asset":{"_ref":"image-493a75003c35646cec79884ad0db7c6da91e56e5-3200x2133-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"Discover your inner entrepreneur and help clients close to home"},"skills":["business-process-improvements","customer-due-diligence-cdd","customer-experience-cx","customer-focused","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","financial-advising","financial-products","procedural-compliance","professional-collaboration"],"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","social-innovation"],"vakgebied":"customer-product","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"8e31ba0b-2444-4cf8-b008-f7c30ebf7cee","title":"Managing risks in a changing IT world","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-role-of-risk-management-jasmin-carlson"},"intro":"A new application to share files digitally. A USB token to unlock your computer. Storing privacy-sensitive information in the cloud. Risk Manager Jasmin Carlson, together with her colleagues, determines what is and is not allowed.","content":"Ensuring that everyone can continue to do their job\n\n“Within Dynamic Risk Management, we proactively assess operational risks, changes within systems and incidents. We look at whether the mitigating measures we have taken are still sufficient. These are measures by which we reduce security risks to a minimum. You can never eliminate risks completely, but you can reduce them to a minimum. Just like you have a lock on your door at home, for example, or a strong password on your computer.”\n\n“We not only assess the risks of applications and systems, but also the external parties we engage with. How good is their security? What is the impact of a change? And how is privacy-sensitive information handled? It is an ongoing process. In the Dynamic Risk Cycle, we identify critical processes and make sure everyone can continue to do their jobs.”\n\n“When the corona crisis started, there was suddenly a great demand for software to meet digitally and to exchange information. We used to use Skype, but it didn’t suffice on this scale. You have to find something else. We assess the risks of alternatives that fit within Rabobank’s policy, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. When using these types of cloud services and collaboration software, we advise on setting up 2-factor authentication, for example.”\n\nJust like a doctor\n\nHow does Dynamic Risk Management work in practice, we ask Jasmin. “We look at the AIC classification, the Availability, Integrity & Confidentiality. We also do a privacy impact analysis. If it goes into the cloud, then additional research is done by the cloud risk assessment team. When we put something live, we want it to be of real use to us, but we also want it to be secure, so that we are not vulnerable to hackers, for example. Cyber security and privacy are very important, especially at the bank.”\n\n“With new applications, or if there is a major change within certain existing software, we look at the pros and cons. Is the security in order? Are the right controls in place? I’m the contact person and bring all these processes together in a risk assessment. In fact, I am a kind of general practitioner. If I don’t know something exactly, then I refer you to a specialist. In the field of privacy, for example, or security. By consulting with other experts, I also gain new knowledge that I can later use in my ‘diagnoses’.”\n\nFrom Risk Professional to Risk Manager\n\n“I started working as a Risk Professional in May 2019. In this role you support the Risk Manager in the risk cycle by collecting information and preparing risk analyses. I was given a warm welcome at Rabobank. It’s a very pleasant culture. Everyone is friendly and you can ask anything. Through good coaching, I have been able to take the next step and became a Risk Manager in November 2019. As Risk Manager, you provide the business with advice. It is an interaction. We have a monitoring plan and identify and assess the risks together. That way we know not only which mitigating measures have been effectively implemented, but also which areas need more attention.”\n\n“In addition, I support our current Risk Professionals, so that those who want to progress get the same opportunities that were given to me. This is how it’s done at Rabobank. I think all my colleagues experience it that way. You get the chance to make the most of it. Sometimes you don’t even realize it”, Jasmin says with a smile.\n\nCelebrating successes together and admitting mistakes\n\nCollaboration is in Jasmin’s blood. “I played softball at top-level sports. Here, too, you stand strong together as a team. You celebrate your successes together, but you can’t always do everything right. This is what a team sport is all about: you learn to admit your own mistakes, but you also learn how to help each other when something can be done better.”\n\n“I like to pass on my knowledge. That’s where my top-level sports history comes in. I was about 14 years old when I started playing major league softball, with ladies who were 10 to 15 years older than me. They supported me in every way. Now I am older myself and train our youth. With the right guidance and instructions, they progress immensely. They are all just as eager to learn as the Risk Professionals I coach at Rabobank. That motivates me. After all, knowledge is worth nothing if you don’t share it.\n\nCreating stories that everyone understands\n\n“To do this work, you have to be, above all, an all-rounder. Someone who is a fast learner, someone who knows a little about every subject and who can make connections. You make the translation between the IT world and non-IT. You don’t just carry out the assessment, but you also have to explain it well. You have to turn it into a story that everyone understands.”\n\n“The work is really diverse. You look at the privacy aspect, the business continuity aspect, risk management, and so on for every application. Every day is different. I can use my expertise in many different activities. Sometimes it’s about communication, as in the case of e-mail traffic, and another time we’re working on the tokens you need to be able to log in at all. I find it very interesting that the IT world is constantly changing and renewing itself. Every day there is something new that you can learn from.”\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\n“I’m from the 1990s, when technology was on the rise. Everyone got a computer at home and after school you would play games. My generation is used to making full use of technology. The corona crisis made us work differently and much more efficiently in that area. I think it has brought about an interesting technological improvement.”\n\n“In a very short period of time, we set everything up so that everyone could easily work from home.

Roxana van Mourik, recruiter at Rabobank, is the perfect person to talk about diversity and inclusion at Rabobank. 'We need role models in visible positions.'\n\n","content":"Update: As of November 2022, Roxana is no longer a recruiter, but a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Associate. In this position, she deals with diversity and inclusion.\n\nSpicing things up a bit at the Croeselaan\n\n“As a recruiter I talk to people to see if they are a match for Rabobank. I work in the wholesale domain, which is internationally oriented. Many job interviews are in English and that makes my work very varied. Before the corona crisis I used to have the interviews at the office, but now of course I do them mainly from home.”\n\n“Lately we are able to go to the office a bit more often. I travel with my guide dog Magic by public transport. By train I get to Rabobank’s head office in fifteen minutes. Magic sits under my desk all day long. Together we spice things up a bit, I always say as a joke.”\n\nJust a regular application\n\n“If I have an appointment for a physical interview, I inform people in advance that I am blind and that my dog is with me. There have been times when I’ve met someone who was very afraid of dogs. It is useful to know this in advance. Of course, you don’t come across a recruiter with my disability very often. People think it’s super cool that I work at such a big bank.”\n\n“I often get asked how I ended up in this job. I found my first job as a recruiter through an organization for people with a disability, but I came to Rabobank through my own network. I knew a recruiter who worked there and presented him with my resume. That’s how the ball started rolling!”\n\nFull participation\n\n“A disability is often seen as a disadvantage, which means that people do not feel comfortable being open about it. And yet you can often make a unique contribution to the work and the company culture. I am just a recruiter who also happens to be blind. We need role models in visible positions to make it clear that Rabobank is open to people with a disability or distance to the labor market and offers all kinds of facilities for them.”\n\n“As a Rabobank employee, you can contact the Inclusive Support Desk for support. I have special software on my laptop that reads out letters and resumes and a braille display. This is a device that you click to your computer that converts text to braille. I also have a special access pass that makes the gates stay open longer, so I can easily pass through with Magic. Of course, this is also useful for people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations.”\n\n“People just don’t know how difficult all kinds of ordinary work is for people with disabilities. When I started, many systems were not accessible for people with a visual impairment and I could only do my work through all kinds of workarounds. This has gotten much better. We have switched to different software, which is accessible. I am now the expert to whom people come and ask how they should do certain things! I can really do my job as a full-fledged recruiter.”\n\nThe importance of accessibility\n\n“Since I joined the team, my colleagues have become more aware of the importance of accessibility. For example, we recently found out that we were being seriously spammed on job applications for certain positions: sometimes you get the same application 30 or 40 times. It is very time-consuming to filter these out. To prevent this, we put a captcha in place. In those cases I emphasize on the option of an audio version, so that the application form remains accessible to people with visual impairments.”\n\nAmbitions for the future\n\n“My colleagues are generally very open-minded. Rabobank is a cooperative bank and you can see that approach in the people who work there. The bank’s mission is ‘Growing a better world together’; in my opinion, diversity and inclusion at Rabobank are an important part of that. But I do think we still talk a little too much and take too little action. I have more and more colleagues with disabilities, but there are still far too few of them. That number has to go up, and not just by saying it’s important, but by really taking action.”\n\n“I previously had a recruitment role where I focused on people with disabilities. Now that I’ve been working at wholesale for a while, I notice that I want to do more with that again. I see myself pulling the cart at Rabobank. My ambition is to get a good managerial position, where I can determine the strategy and say: `Hey guys, this is how we’re going to do it’. That’s my distant dot on the horizon, that seems very cool.”\n\n\n\nInclusive Support Desk\n\n\nWithin Rabobank, the Inclusive Support Desk is an important place for colleagues with special needs. Frans van den Top and Meryem Bakirhan help Rabobank employees with their questions. “These are employees with visual of auditory impairments, or mobility impairments. And colleagues who are neurodiverse or have some form of dyslexia.”, Frans said.\n\n“We offer support to employees with an extra challenge and we help managers when hiring employees with an extra challenge. In addition, we take care of the accessibility of our IT systems, the workplace and our buildings. For example, we can help in adaptations to the elevators or the entrance gates.”\n\nThe Inclusive Desk fills a need according to Frans, “We see an influx of people with a distance to the labor market and we also want them to participate fully in our daily business. We help everyone with a disability.”\n\nThe work of the Inclusive Support Desk is not going unnoticed. Rabobank has been nominated for the CTalents Diamond Awards. Recognizing those who truly make a difference and are committed to inclusion in the workplace. The award ceremony will take place in April 2022.","createdAt":1700834702,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"fb53005eeeae","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"I'm just a recruiter who happens to be blind","image":{"_key":"e0567acd719d","_type":"image","alt":"Roxana van Mourik - Braille ","asset":{"_ref":"image-1232405e43af5b753940f06b2f3dbb06a7b3f0d2-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-analysis","business-process-improvements","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","knowledge-sharing","policy-implementation","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"hr","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"14a6797f-ce17-4260-8a8a-85ace03b16c4","title":"The auditor of the future: people-oriented and data-driven","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-auditor-of-the-future-people-oriented-and-data-driven"},"intro":"“The bank changes, and we auditors change with it. Not simply doing what is said, but taking the initiative yourself, making the difference yourself. We think it is important that our colleagues look for new ways to arrive at valuable findings.”","content":"\n\nRudi Kleijwegt has been Chief Audit at Rabobank since 2016. According to him, the auditor of the future is someone who uses innovative technologies and knows how to make an impact with them. “You can interpret data and transfer your findings to colleagues and management. Even if the message is less pleasant.”\n\nResearch culture and strategy in the organization\n\n“NextGen Audit is a program that prepares us for the future of our field. We take the next step in our technology, processes and methods, and people’s personal and professional development. We develop the most modern audit methods, such as process- and text mining. This enables us to make relevant observations about what is happening within the bank.”\n\n“Our auditors look at more than just data and processes. We also look at the behaviour of the people in our organization. For this, we use the Culture and Behavior framework. We use this to conduct research based on, among other things, questionnaires and interviews. Part of the research is how employees address each other. Both with compliments and with feedback. Our auditor of the future also looks closely at the organization’s strategy.”\n\nThe areas of expertise in Audit\n\n“We have four important domains within Rabobank. First of all, that is the Business domain. These include, for example, the bank’s activities in payment transactions, insurance, assets, customer service and financing. The second domain is KYC & Compliance. An important area for us here is that you audit all activities related to KYC and compliance, as well as HR and Legal. IT, Data & Innovation are the third domain. Here you focus on work related to technology, architecture and hardware. The fourth domain is Risk. You then work broadly in the field of credit, finance, models and general risk management.”\n\n\n\nA nice working environment\n\n“With Agile@Audit methodology, we put together our audit teams in an agile way. We have cross-functional teams that are responsible for their part of Rabobank. This decentralized way of working allows us to adapt to the rapidly changing world in and around the bank.”\n\n“I believe in the added value of a diversely composed audit team. We have colleagues with extensive work experience as auditors or accountants, such as RA or RE training. We also have colleagues from different backgrounds, such as sociology or philosophy. Many of our auditors have gained expertise in the company or the risk or compliance organization.”\n\n\"Within Rabobank, we work with the principles of Rabo@anywhere (https:\u002F\u002Frabobank.jobs\u002Fen\u002Fgrow-magazine\u002Fraboanywhere-the-new-way-of-working-after-corona\u002F). This means that we have great flexibility when working independently of time and place. We divide our workweek to work from home, from one of Rabobank’s central offices, and sometimes from a local office nearby.\"\n\nYou make the difference\n\n“We work at one of the largest audit departments in the Netherlands. That makes the work challenging, and the colleagues deliver high-quality work together. In combination with the pleasant working atmosphere, this makes it a truly unique workplace for me.”","createdAt":1702295681,"updatedAt":1702978827,"representation":{"_key":"4037f57a49f8","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Rudi Kleijwegt in gesprek met collega's","asset":{"_ref":"image-84f35be935cd2c28a81c03a2ba7a037ea6c03ce6-1920x1280-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"The auditor of the future: people-oriented and data-driven"},"skills":["change-agility","communication","compliance-reporting","consulting","data-insights","disciplined-execution","operation-risk-management","professional-collaboration","regulatory-advice","risk-assessments","risk-strategies"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","social-innovation"],"vakgebied":"risk","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"efa393a1-6fc9-4f9a-8566-3f4964d0fcb1","title":"From concrete braiding to picking transactions","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"from-concrete-braiding-to-working-as-a-cdd-analyst-kyc"},"intro":"Ben was a self-employed concrete braider for 16 years. As an entrepreneur, he knows the playing field of making revenue and avoiding risk. \"Now that I'm on the other side of the table, I notice how important it is to know the boundaries of that playing field. As a CDD analyst, I am constantly talking to SMEs to enable a healthy financial system.\"","content":"“Some entrepreneurs make mistakes because of their naiveté. They are not consciously engaging in impermissible behaviour, but do not know the rules well enough. Anyone can register with the Chamber of Commerce without any knowledge of laws and regulations. That bothers me.” Ben speaks as an experienced entrepreneur. “I love entrepreneurship, but after all these years I was no longer taking pleasure in the craft of concrete braiding. I had to change course.” Now he is a CDD analyst at Rabobank. “Inside, I'm still an individual entrepreneur.”\n\nTransactional analysis and entrepreneurial interviews\n\nHe already knew the bank from his entrepreneurship. During his search for a new challenge, a family member suggested to check with Rabobank's FE and Sanctions department. Ben got excited. “From the concrete braiding business, I had experience with construction specifications: I knew how to approach them very analytically to win the best contracts. I wanted to use that mindset in another field as well.” Ben sent an open application for Junior CDD analyst. “Look, I have little experience with what the bank does,” I said during my job interview. “But I do know something of the world and I speak the language of the entrepreneur. I know how to get something done with entrepreneurs.” In combination with his analytical mindset, that experience made Ben suitable for CDD.\n\nBen draws on his experience as an entrepreneur on a daily basis. “I handle open files, and review transaction analyses. That is where the contact with our customers is of great importance. I think that's really very important. A complete customer view helps put a signal in context. You get tunnel vision when you only look at a signal. By talking to the customer, you get an idea of the bigger picture.”\n\nSharing knowledge with entrepreneurs\n\n“I want to help our customers, the entrepreneurs, by sharing my knowledge. By making the risks visible and open for discussion in a conversation. I always find it challenging to spar with an entrepreneur about the playing field between making money and avoiding risk. Entrepreneurship always involves risks, but you don't have to consciously seek them out. If I can clearly convey what can happen from sanctions laws or the WED, Economic Offenses Act, then business owners are able to make better decisions for their business themselves.”\n\n“Sometimes you come across extraordinary files. For example, a case where someone has a very well-run business, with an annual dividend payment of millions, but where dubious money flows across the accounts. Money flows that do not fit the business, are not transparent and can foster corruption. Those are the cases where there might be real issues.” Being keen on that is a key driver for Ben. “For the bank, by removing the future risks, and for the customer, by making it clear that they are doing something that is not allowed by law. Bringing that awareness to entrepreneurs: that's why I do this.”\n\nAlways in development\n\nBen has since advanced to senior CDD analyst. “I took the opportunity to develop further in the field and in my own competencies. In conversation with my team lead, I mapped out my path. I now coach new junior analysts in their growth. I also have ancillary duties, suggesting improvements to policy and litigation documents.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rabobank has its own FEC Campus where new analysts learn the tricks of the trade in a few months. “During that training, you learn the basics, from legislation to internal systems. On campus you will receive a broad education and in your daily work you will then specialise in certain topics, such as transaction risks or sanctions legislation. I guide my colleagues on that career path. How deep should they investigate, what questions do I ask the customer, what is a sufficient answer. Because a lot of the information you get is not unambiguous. You must always be able to find your way through that. This requires analytical insight as well as your common sense. Thinking logically.”\n\nIn control\n\nBen regularly works from his home in Zetten. “I have my own office here with multiple monitors. And I can exercise in my backyard during my lunch break. At Rabobank, you are the conductor of your work-life balance. You work independently and are responsible for your career path. Rabobank's training budget certainly helps with that. I want to grow even further in a consultant role internationally. I can take courses for that internally. I want to further disseminate my knowledge on sanctions, CDD and legislation to customers.”\n\n“Thanks to my profession, I get an inside look at so many different businesses. I see how business is evolving and what is going on. I think that's very important. As I said, I will always remain an entrepreneur after all.”\n\n","createdAt":1701702249,"updatedAt":1704372638,"representation":{"_key":"21df808bf026","_type":"tileQuote","employee":{"avatar":{"_type":"image","alt":"Ben volledig in beeld","asset":{"_ref":"image-3f82852458c41d2332e30ac44b4313695189986f-321x327-png","_type":"reference"}},"functionTitle":"CDD-analist","title":"Ben "},"label":"article","quote":"I work at the bank and still remain an entrepreneur on the inside."},"skills":["business-process-improvements","change-agility","coaching","critical-thinking","customer-focused","decision-making","due-diligence","problem-solving","storytelling"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"page","id":"f560288e-426e-4c6d-bef3-cd32e7a59be4","title":"Innovation: help us to build the future","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"innovation"},"intro":"If you associate working at Rabobank with endless meetings and people who are set in their ways, think again!

That's where I got the chance to participate in this program and get a broader understanding of the bank. When the opportunity knocked, I welcomed it with open arms.\"","content":"Building on a broad foundation\n\n“Before starting this program, I was an analyst on a Rabobank team that focuses on acquisition financing for clients who are being taken over by private equity firms. These investment companies want to put a lot of equity capital into acquiring a majority share in a particular business. Rabobank can help them with financial resources. Acquisition financing is comparable to a mortgage, except it’s for businesses. It was an interesting position that I learned a lot from. But I’m so glad that I’m doing this program now, because I’m discovering how much more Rabobank has to offer Young Professionals like me. The program is helping me build a stronger foundation so I can become a versatile corporate banker.”\n\nProfessional and Personal Growth\n\n“Besides getting to know Rabobank better and getting broad work experience, I’m also getting to know myself better. This combination has helped me take massive leaps as a Young Professional. After all, personal development is at least equally important as professional developoment. During the program you get to work on your soft skills with other Young Professionals. Everything from participating in a training about leadership skills to talking about what you find difficult and which personal goals you would like to work on. I learned what my style of communication is and how to use it to work better in a team. I also discovered one of my weaknesses. I can develop tunnel vision a lot faster than other people. Now that I am aware of this characteristic though, it’s easier to watch out for it.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the program like?\n\n“In the beginning there are several days of introduction so we can get to know Rabobank better. One of the things we learn is what is important to the bank. Because Rabobank focuses on food & agri, during the introduction phase we learn what that means in practice for different departments. For example, granting loans can be linked to achieving sustainability targets. That demonstrates that the bank is more than a lending party; it’s also a valuable partner for companies.”\n\n“Another great thing about the program is that you get to know many other Young Professionals. We participate in a variety of training courses together and we share our experiences. In addition, the program offers the option of doing a rotation in a different department.”\n\nDiverse and Dynamic Work\n\n“I currently work in Acquisition Finance as a credit analyst. My work is diverse and challenging. I have my own portfolio of corporate clients who have loans with us. The value of these clients’ finance packages ranges between a few hundred million to billions of euros; the loans are financed by multiple banks and also partly financed by investors. My clients operate in different sectors, like retail, recruitment, and food & agri. I monitor their financial performance, check the risk profiles, and help the investment managers maintain the client relationship. If something is not right, it is my responsibility to promptly flag it within the bank. What that means in practice is that I do all sorts of applications and draw up reports for our department’s management and the risk department.”\n\n“I also work on new transactions, which is all about bringing in new clients. My job is to work with the deal team to secure internal approval for extending the loan. To do that, I research the new corporate client by reading reports about their business and sector, and I make financial projections based on their financial planning. That way we can accurately assess what the risk will be for the bank. This part of my job has taught me so much about stakeholder mangement because I get to work with so many different internal and external parties. That includes the Know Your Customer department (which is concerned with flagging fraud and money laundering) and the Legal department. I’m also in touch with outside parties like other banks, advisers, and lawyers. In short: this is such a dynamic environment.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the supervision like?\n\n“I have monthly meetings with the young talent manager who supervises me. We talk about how things are going at work, during trainings, and how my development is coming along in terms of my personal goals. The diverse group of Young Professionals also provides a valuable form of supervision. With so many different backgrounds, ambitions, and kinds of knowledge in one group, it enriches your existing network and expands it instantly. I wouldn’t want to miss out on this program for all the money in the world. I definitely see my development progressing, but I’m not yet sure what position I’d like to end up in. Thanks to the program, I have the opportunity to develop a good foundation as a banker while I also have access to the tools I need for further growth. That way, I can make better choices when it comes to my career.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1701706104,"updatedAt":1716553302,"representation":{"_key":"27ebec8d0daa","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Would you like to become a versatile banker through the Young Professional Program in Corporate Banking?","image":{"_key":"e4ddd71f9b8a","_type":"image","alt":"Young women is sitting behind laptop and looking into the camera","asset":{"_ref":"image-e842dc3ab8077b53ea2d1e4cbe9f1662b879e951-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["active-listening","business-analysis","business-strategies","credit-analysis","customer-analytics","data-insights","disciplined-execution","market-research","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"corporate-banking","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"Croeselaan 18","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00106372","city":"Utrecht","consent":["Voluntary gender-identification","Data Retention - 2024"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"nl","display_order":4,"label_de":"Niederlande","label_en":"The Netherlands","label_es":"Países Bajos","label_fr":"Pays-Bas","label_nl":"Nederland","label_pt":"Países Baixos"}],"date_start":1717764735174,"date_updated":1721376547219,"hours_max":"36","job_branch":[{"code":"cdd","display_order":14,"label_de":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)","label_en":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)","label_es":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)","label_fr":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)","label_nl":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)","label_pt":"Financial Economic Crime (FEC)"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"Sta jij ook altijd in de juiste rij bij de supermarkt omdat je hebt gezien hoe de rij ontwikkelt?
