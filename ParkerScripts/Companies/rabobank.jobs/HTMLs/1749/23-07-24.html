with a disability: “Go on that adventure together”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-with-a-disability"},"intro":"In late 2020, Rabobank employee Jurgen van Haperen was diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder, which was partly why he decided to find a job that suited him better. He ended up in Financial Economic Crime. “I can work independently here and my colleagues are understanding of my situation.” He hopes his story will inspire other people with disabilities.","content":"Jurgen doesn’t beat around the bush: “I would like to tell my colleagues that they should always believe in themselves. That’s my most important message. If you know what you’re capable of and believe in yourself, it will all work out in the end. You just have to keep going.” He speaks from experience. When he ran into a career dip, he refused to give up and proved his mettle instead.\n\nHe joined Rabobank in September 2006, holding different reporting positions at Wholesale & Rural for 12 years. In 2018 he moved over to data. Jurgen: “The data role demanded a lot from my communication skills,” he said. “It became clear that conveying the message was not my strong suit. It was hard to hear, but I also knew that my knowledge and skills were strong. I knew what the job was about and I had proven it over several years.”\n\nReintegration track\n\nIn autumn 2019, Jurgen noticed that his job was costing him too much energy. He reached out to the company doctor. Jurgen: “I’d had a hard time recharging my battery after a really busy period at work, so I asked for help. In consultation with the company doctor, I took a step back and my general practitioner pointed me towards a program that would help reveal the cause. I started working again, but I worked fewer hours.”\n\nIn November 2020, he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. He can function perfectly well with this developmental disability, but he does need more time for some things. On the other hand, his “challenge,” as he calls it, works to his advantage. “I can do certain tasks exceptionally fast.” He continued, “Give me a complicated Excel sheet with a lot of data and I’ll have it figured out in half an hour.\"\n\nJurgen discovered what was a good fit for him and what made him happy. “I ended up applying for an in-house position at Financial Economic Crime (FEC). The interview started well, but ended on a low note when I was asked an unexpected question. Something like that throws me off guard, and I can get stuck if I haven’t had time to prepare. I tried to come up with an answer, but I couldn’t. Unfortunately, getting stuck that way was enough to bring an end to the application process.”\n\nBut Jurgen didn’t give up. “I knew that my strong analytical skills meant I’d be right at home at FEC. I shouldn’t be written off because of a single snapshot, right?” He got in touch with different people within Rabobank and quickly established a good network. That was fruitful: “In February 2021 I spoke to somebody in HR. I explained my situation, emphasising that I couldn’t imagine that no-one in FEC would want to give me a chance. She agreed with me and not long after, I was sitting down with the location manager in Amsterdam and my future team leader. The meeting went well right from the start. We agreed that I would complete a two-month in-house course and then join FEC as an analyst.” And so it went. In fall 2021, Jurgen began a new chapter in his career at Rabobank in Zaandam.\n\nPerseverance\n\nIt was a good chapter, but one that ended in late 2023. “I’m a person who has a challenge, and I don’t hide it. I noticed that management expected more from FEC analysts than I had to offer and realized that the position wasn’t 100% for me. So I had a look at other internal roles and found a model tester position at FEC. The role was more structured and that’s something I need. I got the job, af first on secondment, and could stay on if I still liked it after three months. There’s no doubt in my mind though, I am really excited about this new opportunity and I know I can do it.”\n\nIgnorance\n\nJurgen sees that Rabobank is making good strides when it comes to inclusiveness. But not everyone is “up to date\" yet. \"I notice that the opportunities I get often depend on who I meet within the bank. That’s because there is still a lot of ignorance about autism. So it’s important to be open about your additional challenges. Being transparent and honest with those around you about what your challenges are works to your advantage. Because you know better where your strengths and weaknesses lie, you don't have to hide your challenges and other people can help you brainstorm about the which roles would suit you best.”\n\nJurgen also wants to support team leaders and managers with tips like: dare to think out of the box. \"Choose people with communication skills, but also people with analytical skills. Don’t go looking for unicorns, because they don't exist. For example, I know that I am very meticulous, down to the smallest details. Dare to choose different qualities for a team. Give people space but go on that adventure together.\"","createdAt":1712058790,"updatedAt":1712059488,"representation":{"_key":"eb2e05f9455b","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working with a disability: “Go on that adventure together”","image":{"_key":"aa0df655e59c","_type":"image","alt":"Man sits on the couch and looks into the camera","asset":{"_ref":"image-d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["inclusiveness","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"page","id":"f560288e-426e-4c6d-bef3-cd32e7a59be4","title":"Innovation: help us to build the future","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"innovation"},"intro":"If you associate working at Rabobank with endless meetings and people who are set in their ways, think again!

According to Teamlead (FEC TM) Manual Signals Daniëlle, those are the most important traits for getting started in Financial Economic Crime (FEC). But you don’t have to be a sleuth. \"We want to discover how to prevent financial crime.\"","content":"“When I was doing my master’s degree in International Studies, I focused on Latin America and the theme of Global Security. I researched topics such as world politics, economics, and corruption. I knew then that I wanted to do something related to fighting financial crime after I graduated. Just not yet where, or what exactly. That's why I went traveling after completing my degree, while keeping an eye on LinkedIn, where I saw a position at Rabobank.\n\nStarting in a new field\n\nDanielle started out as an FEC analyst in the Transaction Monitoring (TM) department. \"In 2019, I joined a team of enthusiastic, inquisitive people. Most, like me, were fresh out of school. Only a few colleagues had previously worked in the justice system, policing, or criminal investigation. Little was known about FEC (which had only just been established) at that time within the organization and things were progressing rapidly. Fortunately, there was plenty of room and attention for development. In addition to customer research, we worked on knowledge transfer and policy direction.\"\n\n\nTools to grow\n\nThe field grew explosively, so initially the department was focused on handling cases. Once the department was set up, the focus shifted to people. Within FEC, that led to smaller teams with more personal attention. So within three years, Daniëlle became a team leader and was helping 15 team members grow in the profession.\n\n\"The opportunity presented itself and I seized it,\" Danielle says in a surprisingly calm tone. \"Yes, I hear that more often,\" she laughed. \"I'm very calm, unlike the pressure cooker of my career.\" Of course, I also had my doubts. Can I do this, is this moving too fast? Fortunately, Rabobank believed in me and gave me all the necessary tools to grow.\"\n\nPreventing fraud\n\nAs an FEC analyst, you check transactions and investigate where the money is coming from. In Transaction Monitoring, you can specialize in two areas. Team Alerts focuses on reports coming from Rabobank's internal transaction monitoring system. Team Signals conducts investigations based on external signals. \"Both teams look at transactions, just from a slightly different angle. I work in Team Signals. We deal with external reports: a newspaper article, a call from CDD (Customer Due Diligence) or a tip from an entrepreneur or collaboration partner about possible fraud.\"\n\n\nAs an example, Danielle describes what is known as tap fraud or contactless payment fraud. \"Tap fraud is when store employees pretend that a customer has returned something, but put their own debit card on the device for the refund. It often occurs at businesses that sell shoes or clothing, because returns are fairly common there. The company that supplied the payment machines discovered a pattern. They—like us—are required by law to check the transactions made with their devices. What amounts are involved, is it a return, can we detect an abnormal pattern? They transfer the data to us and we investigate what exactly is happening. If we think something is really not right, we inform the business.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we help entrepreneurs who face this kind of risk think about how we can prevent this from happening. Can we set conditions that limit this kind of fraud? Today, you have a limit on the maximum amount you can top up at a store or gas station. Yes, we can act quickly to stop a questionable transaction, but ideally we want to prevent tap fraud. That's what our gatekeeper role is all about.\"\n\nLearning about the world and working on yourself\n\nNew analysts on Team Signals first undergo five months of training at the Transaction Monitoring Campus. There, in addition to doing customer research, it's all about personal development. Where would you like to end up and what opportunities are there?\n\n\n\"The most important skills you need are logical reasoning and flexibility. The work environment is changing rapidly. When a country suddenly ends up on the sanctions list, it has an immediate impact on your work and you have to be able to switch gears quickly. In addition, you should enjoy figuring things out most of all. Being curious. You learn about business: corporate structures, taxes, imports, and exports. And we don't separate cases into private or corporate, so you deal with all kinds of files and cases. One day it’s crypto, another day it's foreign risks. You learn an awful lot about the world.\"\n\n\n\n\"As team lead, besides operations, I also do some HR work. I conduct job interviews with new analysts, do salary negotiations, and supervise reintegration processes. I completed a variety of courses to learn about everything from coaching to drawing up a plan for the UWV (Employee Insurance Agency). I am also working on my personal development through the coaching program for team leads: the focus there is on my own talents, qualities, and challenges.\"\n\n\"What do I want to do next? I don't know yet. You can go in any direction within Rabobank, like management or another department. As team leader you can basically work for any team. But for the time being, I will remain team leader at FEC. In addition to keeping up with cases and files, I answer questions and brainstorm about the future of this departmentwith the management team. The role is extremely versatile, which suits me fine.\"\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1707906015,"updatedAt":1708001748,"representation":{"_key":"2095a6092784","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Danielle","asset":{"_ref":"image-a3ee2155e05915808264ca28d95886c2692c047a-3074x5464-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"label":"article","title":"Protecting entrepreneurs from new forms of fraud"},"skills":["business-process-improvements","change-agility","coaching","critical-thinking","decision-making","problem-solving"],"proofPoints":["leadership","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"afd1c03e-3139-4262-bf94-0cfa0c9dc1dd","title":"Legal work where you have to be able to empathize with the client","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"legal-work-where-you-have-to-be-able-to-empathize-with-the-client"},"intro":"\"Sometimes the situation for an entrepreneur has deteriorated so much due to internal or external factors that his business is no longer viable.

She started out as account manager Afbouw & Insolventie for the department of Special Asset Management and has since been promoted to team leader. She talks about her work and what it takes to do the work in the best possible way.\n\n\"The process of the final closure of his business requires empathy for the entrepreneur. The customer is actually in the process of mourning, when he sees his life's work go under. Entrepreneurs go through different phases of acceptance and you have to be able to deal with that and respond to them emphatically. Afterwards, we regularly hear that they are relieved and happy with the guidance they have received.\"\n\nBanking and customer interests can sometimes clash\n\n\"Because banking and customer interests can clash, we always advise the customer to take on his own advisor. Even though we are looking for the best possible solution for both parties, everyone defends their own interests.We consider an honest and unambiguous relationship with customers to be an important starting point and we receive positive feedback on this approach.\"\n\n“The customer's future after the insolvency is very important to us. For example, we always try to prevent the most serious consequences for their personal situation. After all, these are issues that have the greatest impact on the daily life of the entrepreneur. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work out, but I really believe that Rabobank's policy on remaining debt is the right one.\"\n\nBeing of added value in a difficult situation\n\n\"This work is a good combination of working on legal issues as well as being in contact with the client. It is precisely in such a difficult situation that the bank can offer added value by coming up with a workable solution together. The way Rabobank deals with the customer in this situations suits me very well.\"\n\n\"Financial and legal knowledge form the basis; knowing what works and what doesn’t work. You talk to clients, but also, for example, to liquidators. You have to be well versed in order to be able to communicate effectively with various parties and make the appropriate arrangements. And since you're working on several files in different phases of insolvency, it's also useful to be able to maintain an overview.\"\n\nStronger together\n\n\"We share our experiences internally with other departments, such as Account management and Special Asset Management.

Beautiful words, but how do you deal in actuality with someone who reacts differently? Who asks questions that other people might not dare to ask. We talk about it with Asuerus van Tuijl, who has autism, and his manager Robert van Putten. ‘We can find a place for everybody'.","content":"Asuerus is a Service Analyst at Rabobank in the Customer & Service Monitoring department: \"I call myself a jack of all trades. For example, I arrange authorizations within the department, for both colleagues and customers. I also manage the website, make reports for vulnerabilities and do other odd jobs. I don't like routine and in this role I have a lot of variety. I work with people, computers and technology and I work on the organization and the culture. It's very challenging.\"\n\nRobert: \"Asuerus has an open role. He works in with several different teams and other departments also know how to find him. This position is also really focused on Asuerus. When I started in this department, I was looking for someone who could help us with authorization-related issues. Someone who enjoys figuring out things like that. I immediately thought of Asuerus, because I already knew him from a previous department.\"\n\nLooking at capabilities\n\nAsuerus: \"I was out of work for a while and then I volunteered at ITvitae, an organization that helps IT people with high-functioning autism or highly gifted people to find work. Through ITvitae, I ended up at Rabobank. I have experienced the application as really positive. They know that you have come from ITvitae and therefore have a challenge, but they didn't look at that when I applied. Just whether you fit in with the department.\"\n\nRobert: \"ITvitae supports us with clear instructions, when they bring in a new employee. These are unique for each person. What things to discuss, what agreements to make, what to do in what situation. That has helped me a lot.\"\n\nListening to each other\n\nAsuerus doesn't need any specific adjustments: \"It's mainly the match between me and the department and the person in charge of the department. They need to know what to expect from me and how to address me and vice versa. And that's all the adjustment I need.\"\n\nRobert: \"I didn't take any training or course to understand this further, but I'm just in constant conversation with Asuerus: what's going on, what do you need, how can I help you do your job in an enjoyable way. It actually comes naturally to me, it's not a specific management style.\"\n\nAsuerus adds: \"Yes, actually it is. It's just not something you can learn. It's more the person you are. Being open to the other person, being a good listener and trust are most important.\"\n\nInclusion at Rabobank\n\nAsuerus: \"I see that Rabobank pays a lot of attention to diversity and inclusion. On the policy side, a lot is happening to create an inclusive corporate culture where people make use of each other's talents. In practice, however, this is not always easy. It is also often difficult - or more difficult than Rabobank would like - to give people who are a little different a place. That is because of the difference between people with and without autism. My disability only started to 'bother' me when I began to work.\"\n\n\"My expectations were way too high. Everything was different than I had imagined: people interacted very differently and communication was not always smooth. My biggest problem was with people who found my being different inconvenient. I just don't want to be bothered by people too much. I am practicing to let my voice be heard in situations I find difficult. Because if I don't mention things, then no one else will learn from it either.\"\n\nRobert agrees: \"You used to avoid situations like that. You have to find the right route. For example, we have a set time every month when we talk to each other. But if there are some things going on, we speak to each other every week. In fifteen minutes Asuerus brings me up to speed, we give each other feedback and I can make adjustments if necessary.\"\n\nWorking on a place for everyone\n\nAsuerus: \"As far as I'm concerned, the practical application of the inclusion policy should focus on communication and work etiquette. Fortunately, the bank is very open to our ideas. I am a member of the RAP aan de Slag, our employee network for colleagues with occupational disabilities. The bank regularly asks us how we see things and in what way they can help us further.\"\n\n\"We think there is a place for everyone within the bank. One of the things we're doing is developing training for colleagues on what neurodiversity is and how to deal with it. We're looking for ways to tell our story. I actually see us as the canary in the coal mine: we identify sensitivities in the organization. And help think about improvements.

In the medium term, it would become annoying. And in the long run, disastrous. Because then no one would have worked on building the future.”","content":"The field of Business Architecture concerns three elements, Joost explains. The structure of IT systems, the business processes that support them, and the people who work with them. “As a Business Architect, I don’t provide the IT, but rather the vision of what IT and its processes should look like in a few years. That’s what enterprise architecture is about”.\n\nFast, efficient and accurate\n\nEach business architect at Rabobank has their own domain. “I work in the Wholesale & Rural domain, which deals with wholesale clients who are based abroad and are usually related to the food chain. This includes food production, transportation and processing, but also large farms from Australia and Brazil. The business architecture under my care deals with the application and management process of these clients’ loans. It has to be as fast, efficient and accurate as possible.”\n\n\n\nMake the process work\n\nWithin this process, Joost is looking into the systems related to the application form. “And that’s not a simple form, but a huge mountain of data, from which you have to extract the right decision parameters. So that you are able to present it to someone who ultimately decides whether or not we will do business with the client.”\n\nJoost explains more about the nature of this data. “There are all kinds of issues to deal with between offer and concluded loan. Who should approve this client? And on what basis? We also perform risk and capital calculations, and for that we need to have a good understanding of the client’s business structure and financial data. Getting all that data on a scratch book or in an Excel file takes too much time. With automation and optimizations, we make this process workable.”\n\nThe dream: an end-to-end application process\n\nThe dot on the horizon? Joost refers to the beginning of the conversation. “That’s what I mean by designing the future. What we’re doing now doesn’t exist yet. A complete end-to-end application process, that’s the dream.” Joost adds that for him it’s about more than the end result. “The result is going to take years. For me, the moment of success is earlier, when I know the direction we want to go.”\n\n\n\nListen and be curious\n\nWhat qualities come in handy as a business architect? “People often think of the complex, analytical part of the job first. Of course that’s part of it, but always in consultation with colleagues. Not only are you curious about systems and processes, but you also want to know how other people think about them. The work is a lot of listening and talking (and in that order!) to arrive at the right insights.”\n\nComplex business, continuous challenges\n\nWhen asked what makes this work so interesting, Joost doesn’t have to think long. “It’s incredible to be working on the bank of the future. Rabobank is a large and complex company with continuous challenges. Not just from a regulatory perspective, but because we want to innovate as a company. The design challenges involved are simply fantastic.”\n\n","createdAt":1704375536,"updatedAt":1705055142,"representation":{"_key":"26ddc213afeb","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Design the bank of the future as a Business Architect","image":{"_key":"2585b701ae2b","_type":"image","alt":"Joost is posing","asset":{"_ref":"image-9df80d07a5f684c59238009b5d151a1f7f8bfa8a-1920x944-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"7f3c729d-abec-437c-9182-d9dd5601d3ee","title":"Working at a data-driven and innovative bank","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-at-a-data-driven-and-innovative-bank-joost-kimmel"},"intro":"There are several reasons why it’s interesting for a BI Developer to work at Rabobank.

How does hybrid working work out for first-time job seekers? Does it weigh in the decision for a certain employer? And how do you build a network in these times? We ask Frieke Ketelaars, Junior Data Analyst and participant in YPP, Rabobank's Young Professional Program.","content":"“I started in July as a Junior Data Analyst within Global Transaction Monitoring. This is a part of Tech4FEC, FEC. My team translates third party software into an in-house application. The software is used to tackle money laundering, among other things. In addition, I am following the YPP, Rabobank’s start-up program. \n\nDecide for yourself when and where you work\n\n“The onboarding for my position as a Data Analyst started completely digitally. The type of work I do, IT, lends itself well to working online. For some meetings it’s more convenient to be together, but since some of our team members work from abroad, we always have a hybrid form. You just have to coordinate well with each other: what do you do digitally and when is it better to meet at the office.”\n\n“Within Rabobank, you can partly decide when you work in the office and when at home. That flexibility, that you choose how you arrange your days, works great. For me, networking is important. I like to go to the office to meet people. But if I continue to work in the office afterwards, I consciously look for a place where I can concentrate well.”\n\n“I can easily imagine that when you have children, flexibility in work\u002Flife balance is important to you. Or, depending on where and how far you live from work, time spent commuting. My commute isn’t too bad, go to the office by bike. I enjoy getting some fresh air.”\n\nYoung Professional Program\n\n“My batch of the YPP started in October which allowed for more opportunities to meet with each other than for the previous batch. They started completely online. The first 6 months you do technical training within the YPP IT and work on your personal development. Who are you, what do you want, what do you do well and what not so well? We then discuss this with each other. You really get to know yourself.”\n\n“Talking about personal things is a lot easier for me offline. Through a screen, it’s harder to create an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable. That’s why we work together physically on the Fridays of the YPP. We are all in the same phase: just finished studying and started working. It’s nice to meet everyone in real life, work together and have a drink afterwards.”\n\n“Building a network is important to me, both professionally and socially. Of course, I’m already in the YPP, which helps, but when it’s convenient, I also like to participate in activities of Jong Rabo. This is the network for young employees within Rabobank. Company visits, debates, sailing together: all sorts of things are organized. I like meeting different people. It doesn’t always have to be about work.”\n\nGoing abroad\n\n“The YPP IT program includes two business challenges. Together with your team you work on, for example, a tool to develop digital skills, a prototype or a mobile app. You can complete the second challenge abroad if you wish.”\n\n“Hybrid working has made it easier to have a part of the team work from home and part on location. It’s just harder to sell the fact that you actually have to go abroad. Despite the fact that a lot can be done digitally, I would love to go abroad. It is a unique opportunity! Traveling and spending time in a totally different environment is fantastic. Especially if you get to know the culture and people well.”\n\nCommunicating through the screen\n\n“I originally applied for a different job opening at Rabobank than the position I am currently working in. When I called to find out more, I got into a conversation with the contact person for that position. He took the time to talk to me about whether this would be the best role for me given my background and education. He then directed me to another job opening with the opportunity to participate in YPP IT.”\n\n“The job application process took place online, but I was used to that by now. What I liked was that the interviews were informal. It felt very natural. That is special, because I find it difficult to read someone’s body language online. I thought, if you can already convey this feeling through the screen, then I will feel at home in the team in real life as well.”\n\n“Another thing that weighed in on my choice of Rabobank is that by working within Global Transaction Monitoring you really contribute to society. What I do helps in the fight against money laundering and terrorism. I had previously looked at jobs with the police, I find preventing crime interesting, but I certainly didn’t expect to end up doing this at a bank. And certainly not partly working from home!”","createdAt":1701768938,"updatedAt":1716553163,"representation":{"_key":"ce8efaf4441e","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"title":"How do starters experience hybrid work?","label":"article","image":{"_key":"b83fbb42ef0e","_type":"image","alt":"Frieke staat op afdeling kantoor","asset":{"_ref":"image-50a0638bde9145d8d62b1adfd999275c3b278c44-1920x1080-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["rabo-anywhere","way-of-working"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"03003030-554d-4317-9faf-789d81b9e33a","title":"UN Women's Representative - Enaam Ahmed Ali","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"enaam-ahmed-ali-is-vrouwenvertegenwoordiger-voor-de-verenigde-naties"},"intro":"The climate crisis is not only an ecological disaster, but also poses serious dangers to the position of women. Enaam Ahmed Ali, Business Manager at Rabobank and UN Women's Representative 2022, explains exactly what this is like; also while speaking at the United Nations General Assembly. \"People often don't know that this is an issue. That's why I'm working on raising awareness.\"","content":"The Netherlands is one of the few countries to take a women’s representative to the United Nations. “Why are we doing this?” Enaam talks about how we value the position of women in the Netherlands: “The Netherlands has always made a strong case for women’s rights. We are very progressive in this regard, but there is definitely work to be done.”\n\n“My predecessor, Angela Maas, is a cardiologist. She carried out groundbreaking research into the differences between a man’s heart and a woman’s heart. Those differences turned out to be significant: a heart attack in a woman presents itself differently and is less likely to be recognized as such. Her research is helping to bring those numbers down.”\n\nThe impact of the climate crisis on women’s empowerment\n\n“The Women’s Representative chooses her own theme. For me, it’s climate combined with the possibilities of technology. Throughout the year I work on raising awareness and venture out into the country to get inspiration for my speech.”\n\n“I am active on social media and give presentations, preferably at meetings for young people. When I talk about how climate change affects women disproportionately harder than men, I often hear, ‘I didn’t know this was an issue at all.’”\n\n\n\n“Extreme weather, whether it’s drought or flooding, can quickly put people in developing countries in a difficult situation. There is a lack of food and families struggle to make ends meet. This results in more girls being married off, because parents are desperate. This way they have one less mouth to feed, and it brings in much-needed money, so the rest of the family can survive.”\n\n“What you also see is that people have to leave their homes because the land no longer produces crops. They often end up in refugee camps. These are generally not the safest environments, especially for women. That’s how climate change is leading to a huge growth in sexual violence against women and girls. As UN Women’s Representative, I want to bring this to the attention of the world, including the United Nations.”\n\nA complex field of work\n\nThe Women’s Representative participates in the Commission on the Status of Women and gives a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations. Within this field of work, Enaam brings her vision on the future of climate, technology and gender to the attention of the public.\n\n“At the Commission on the Status of Women, you work together on a document with voluntary agreements, known as agreed conclusions, between member states. These documents can be used by countries when making policy. It’s hard work to get your vision reflected in the document. Not only do you have to agree on what will be in the document, but also how it will be there. We call this agreed language.”\n\n“Something that was much discussed, was the phrase ‘Women, in all their diversities’. We just can’t get everyone to agree on this terminology. There are many countries that have difficulty with this phrase, because it means that they also have to recognize trans women as women. And a lot of countries don’t want that, because they don’t support it in principle or because of religion. In this case, it’s very important to reach some kind of agreement. I am an optimist, but this is one that still needs to be worked on.”\n\n\n\nAddressing the United Nations General Assembly\n\nIn September, Enaam gets to address the United Nations General Assembly as Women’s Representative. In a 7-minute speech, she speaks about her theme and the actions she would like to see.\n\n“The 7 most important minutes of my life!” Enaam laughs, quickly adding “So far, that is. I’m not sure yet what I want to say in my speech. My themes are climate and technology, and I want to talk about both. In terms of form, I’m thinking of a personal story, not necessarily mine, but a real story of a woman who has experienced the effects of climate change. That makes it human and brings it closer.”\n\nThe dangers of innovation to emancipation\n\nEnaam fulfills the role of UN Women’s Representative alongside her job at Rabobank. She follows the Diverse Leadership program, a track that prepares you for senior management. Every 6 months you fulfill a different role. Among other things, Enaam worked for Wholesale & Rural Innovation, did an assignment for Sustainability and is now Business Manager for one of the members of the group management.\n\n“At Wholesale & Rural Innovation, I learned a lot about the position of women in developing countries. About biases that play a role within innovation and technology, and the effect of climate change on the development of countries and women in particular.”\n\n“Many climate solutions are based on innovation and digitalization, but it is not the holy grail. Technology, in addition to solutions, also brings additional dangers for women. For example, because of biases in algorithms, which are used to automate decisions. Also, the digital illiteracy of women is generally higher than that of men. This creates a greater distance between the two in society.”\n\n\n\nStand for what is important to you\n\n“I have a hard time with dishonesty. At home, I was expected to do my best in school, but also to be a good housewife later on. From a young age, I felt a difference between my two brothers and me and my three sisters. I just thought it was unfair, that’s where the seed was planted. And as I got older, I saw that there is actually a lot more unfairness in the world. That’s what made my motivation grow.”\n\n“I talk to people a lot. Young people, but also women who are older than me. They offer different perspectives, perhaps because of the age gap. By connecting with people with different perspectives, you gain knowledge. It makes your own thoughts sharper. I get a lot of energy from it!”\n\n“For young women at the beginning of their career, I would say: get to know yourself well. What do you find important, what not, and where are your limits?

As a Business Architect within FEC (Financial Economic Crime) Tech, he is constructing a digital working environment that all FEC analysts are using. His goal? To ensure that this environment remains solid and adaptable not only now, but also in the future.","content":"Business Architect at FEC Tech\n\nThe work of a Business Architect is akin to that of a traditional architect, Nik explains. “Before anything is built, I think like an architect about what it needs to fulfil. How can I ensure that this working environment remains rock-solid ten years from now, while also allowing for expansion with new technologies?”\n\n\n\nMusic of the future\n\n“We’re working towards a shared environment where all analysts can seamlessly collaborate.” This environment is designed to streamline individual work processes and enhance cooperation among different teams. “FEC has grown significantly, resulting in various isolated ‘islands.’ My task, with the help of this platform, is to ensure that these ‘islands’ move harmoniously. Beyond improved collaboration, this work environment also enables us to easily exchange technical components.”\n\n\n\n\nGatekeeper Role\n\nThe work environment is being built using Pega technology, Nik explains. He’s referring to Pega Platform, a leading provider of software for business process management. Nik even flew to the headquarters in Boston last year to collaborate with fellow architects on improvements.\n\nSuch a work environment is not only beneficial for Rabobank but also for organizations worldwide. “So many companies are fighting financial crime—we fulfil that gatekeeper role together.” Fortunately, they connect with each other at events such as the Leaders in Finance AML (Anti Money Laundering) conference,. A conference where “seventy different organizations were present—banks, as well as institutions like the DNB, the FIU, and law enforcement—to discuss shared responsibility in this field.”\n\n\nTrust Relationship\n\nAs a Business Architect, Nik serves as a connecting link. He carefully considers feedback from analysts and input from management, incorporating all perspectives into the development of the work environment. Change management is also a crucial aspect of his role. Nik understands that while you can devise the perfect technological solution, it must also be understood. For this, more than just logical arguments are necessary; you need to build a trust relationship\n\n\nSocial Impact\n\nIt’s clear that Nik is happy with his move to become a Business Architect. “The most exciting aspect of this work is the opportunity for greenfield thinking. Rather than dwelling on today’s obstacles, we focus on what’s possible in the future.”\n\nFor Nik, who previously expressed his creativity through music, this approach feels like a familiar melody. “Just like in music, starting from a blank canvas, I can channel my creativity here as a business architect exploring all the possibilities. It means letting go of everything and asking myself: How would we shape this in an ideal world?”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711722353,"updatedAt":1714124140,"representation":{"_key":"89d49f494d78","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Nik","asset":{"_ref":"image-1e02e5c8ab1a34291a7d0115b91732af6411d69f-7008x4672-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":0.9001889144669607,"width":0.40967716582833913,"x":0.4529922694376069,"y":0.49662186893590404}},"label":"article","title":"From turntables to dashboards: the work of Business Architect Nik at Rabobank FECtech."},"skills":["business-networking","business-process-improvements","change-agility","data-insights","solution-architecture"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"0f4d5ce8-f931-45ea-bcc8-d2d0fc1789fa","title":"Working on the housing future of the Netherlands","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"working-on-the-housing-future-of-the-netherlands"},"intro":"Started as a trainee and now Tribe Lead of Housing. Huib De Mulder is committed to a better housing future. Not only with smart mortgages, but also by making existing homes more sustainable and building affordable new homes. 'We do more than what a bank would normally do. Rabobank really wants to help solve the housing problem.'","content":"\"I started as a trainee at Rabobank in the Wholesale branch, where I worked on financing the large food and agri companies. That's where I really learned the banking business. After 8 years it was time to broaden my horizons and I switched to the retail branch that focuses on private clients. Now I am Tribe lead Housing and responsible for everything Rabobank does around housing. These days, that's much more than just providing mortgages.\"\n\n\"At Rabobank, we work in Tribes which are themselves made up of Areas. The Housing Tribe consists of 8 Areas. Our services are very broad: from orientation and advice to the arranging mortgages and the service and management thereafter. In the coming years, we will be working towards greater speed and digital convenience for our customers, without losing sight of human contact. You can have a conversation with our advisors both online and face-to-face.\n\nTribe Housing: more than a mortgage lender\n\n“We work hard within Tribe Housing, but we also pay close attention to each other. We have a very open culture. Once every two weeks, we get together to celebrate what's going well, but we also look at what's not going so smoothly. That's where you learn from and see how you can do things differently next time.\"\n\n\"The Tribe's mission is 'Living Sustainably and Financially Healthy Together.' We help our customers to keep their financial situation sound. For example, offering more insight into the status of their mortgage or online advice on sustainability. Our ambition is to be more than a mortgage lender.\"\n\nSolar panels and sustainable, affordable housing\n\n\"When talking about housing, a number of social transitions in the Netherlands are very relevant. For example, access to the housing market is a very current issue. But climate risks and making homes more sustainable are also subjects that we are concerned with. It is the combination of innovation and enterprise that makes this subject so interesting.\"\n\n“How can we help make homes more sustainable, for example? You can advise your customers on solar panels or insulation and how to do it, but we really take that a step further. As a cooperative bank, we want to make an active contribution to improving the housing market. To this end, we have set up a campaign in which we think along and contribute to a better housing future in all sorts of ways.\"\n\nThe financing, but also ensure, via a partner, that they are installed on the roof. It is a huge success: 30,000 customers have signed up so far.\"\n\nWe are working with a project developer to build 15,000 affordable rental homes together with BPO, our subsidiary and largest area developer in the Netherlands. We also have the ambition to build 12,000 SmartBuilds: sustainable, temporary rental homes. And because, as a cooperative, we are not looking for maximum profit, we can also guarantee an affordable rent. As far as I'm concerned, this goes further than what a bank would normally do. We really want to participate in solving the housing problem.\"\n\nDriven by social motivation\n\n\"I have always had a great affinity with the bank's cooperative mission. I would like to give meaning to being a banker in a socially responsible way. As far as I'm concerned, a good banker is a person of trust with whom you can discuss your financial possibilities and opportunities, but also concerns, in order to achieve your own ambitions.\"\n\n\"Having a sense of social issues is very important. Contributing to a financially healthy life or increasing sustainability is what motivates people to work here. Personally, I have that motivation as well. I was raised with the idea that together we can make the world a little better and that it is good to take care of each other. I am really proud of what we are building as a bank.\"","createdAt":1700839963,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"c62430c590ff","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Working on the housing future of the Netherlands","image":{"_key":"88cf09705f32","_type":"image","alt":"Huib de Mulder - lachend","asset":{"_ref":"image-c0bc8fdb0e6c147eaf47f634405e2ea6d9298eaa-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"proofPoints":["social-innovation","transitions"],"vakgebied":"customer-product","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"vakgebied","id":"db97cf49-a9cd-4833-b8dd-91b365b1324b","title":"Staff & Operations","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"staff-operations"},"intro":"Rabobank is one of the biggest companies in the Netherlands. It takes a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes effort to keep the organization running day in and day out.

Kiki Ruedisueli spoke enthusiastically about her work and the role that robots and storytelling play in it.","content":"“What does a Business Controller Operations do? We act as sparring partners and trusted advisers for the departments we are responsible for—in my case, that is Operations. As Business Controller, I report to the management team on figures and budgets. I like to say that we are “the financial conscience.” This means that in the work we do and the advice we give, we are always mindful of the fact that it must contribute to the ambition of being a healthy bank. In addition, I find it important that the insights I share fit within the scope, strategy, and ambitions of Rabobank without losing sight of the people behind it.”\n\nFrom junior to management team\n\n“I started at Rabobank in a temp role and was then hired as a Business Controller. I've been doing that for about three and a half years now, but I've had so many opportunities and developed so much that it feels like I've had several jobs. In this role, it's important to understand how the organization works, what we do for our customers, and how we can strengthen each other within Rabobank. I see Operations as the “purring engine” of Rabobank. The department employs around 4,000 people who work directly for the benefit of our customers every day. What we do here matters to the outside world. The figures we calculate have an impact on society.”\n\n“From a junior position focused on general processes and reporting, I progressed to coordinating work such as the multi-year budget (midterm planning) and then became a trusted advisor to the management team. Every month, I present figures and insights to the management team, which bases its decisions on them. We discuss Rabobank’s budgets, future budgets, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Based on the figures, I explain the actions we can take. What I like is how Operations sees their Business Controllers as full MT members. You slot into the management team’s routine, joining them for everything from regular meetings to annual plans.”\n\n\n\nRobots enable storytelling\n\nWithin Operations, Kiki works for the Payments Department and, since recently, the Robotics Wealth Building and Insurance Department (RVV). Kiki: “They are not robots like in the movies, but solutions for automating processes, ranging from automatically sorting activities by priority to the automatic preparation of files. It is so wonderful to see how much value this creates across the bank. The other day, my fellow Business Controllers and I were brainstorming about the potential of robots in our profession. Which processes can we outsource? How can we get insights quickly? A lot of time goes into producing reports even though it would be more valuable to spend that time analyzing and advising.”\n\n“The way you explain figures is so important. I focus on the story behind the figures, that's where my role adds value: storytelling. It’s a skill that is becoming increasingly important, alongside skills such as complex problem-solving and analytical skills. Storytelling brings to life the story behind a hard number. As Business Controllers, we move from numbers to consultancy. We also call this a move from Chief Finance Officer to Chief Value Officer. This is why I think storytelling is an incredibly important skill to keep developing.”\n\nPersonal development\n\nRabobank offers all kinds of opportunities for personal and professional development. As an employee, you can arrange your own development path and your career, for example with the personal development budget. Kiki: “My manager and I look at which areas I want to develop further in. What appeals to me, what do I still want to learn, where can I contribute? I am very eager to learn and enjoy acquiring new knowledge. For instance, I attend seminars on leadership or knowledge sessions. But I also like talking to people on the floor about how they do their work. Another option is to temporarily join another department. I got to work at Investor Relations for six months on the publication of the annual figures. That was incredibly valuable for my development. The culture is open, everyone is always willing to brainstorm with you or explain something.”\n\nRecovery time does not appear to be a word in Kiki's dictionary. “That’s true! But, because we work hybrid at Rabobank, I have the freedom to have a flexible schedule. After an intensive session, I love to go for a long walk in the woods with my dogs just to clear my head and let everything sink in. When I get back, I return to work fresh. I am 110% committed to our customers and my colleagues. I believe that by doing your job well, by really going that extra mile, you make the world a better place.”\n\nWhen asked where she will be in five years, Kiki replied, “I find that an incredibly difficult question. I have broad interests and the opportunities within the bank are endless, so I'm sure the next one will present itself. And in the words of Pippi Longstocking, “I've never tried that before, so I think I definitely should be able to do that.” Perhaps I’ll go see what’s happening around IT or make a parallel step to another position. As far as I'm concerned, growth can be both horizontal and vertical. My path is not yet finished at Rabobank, I am 100% sure of that.”","createdAt":1701878319,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"d52b8037e46c","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Making numbers come alive with storytelling","image":{"_key":"8a47fe4e2552","_type":"image","alt":"Woman in blue suit (Business Controller) standing at glass wall.","asset":{"_ref":"image-ba40b400df8918a092d47e2b68dd185867750319-1613x1075-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-acumen","business-process-improvements","business-reporting","change-agility","customer-focused","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","storytelling","data-insights","risk-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"finance-risk","language":"en","_type":"article"}]}}--><ul class="_79796c68cf5911fbd2dbd74422b69f16"><li class="ab5e6d97237498e01dc155feddef0354 ebca9b82ae8da6d5f010fd3485009826" style="grid-area: amp; opacity: 1; transform: none;"><button aria-label="My skills" class="_161ac6961b45fbbb9fa7d8a502dcea14" data-x="link-to-skillsmatchportal" type="button">My skills</button></li><li class="ab5e6d97237498e01dc155feddef0354" style="grid-area: tile-1; opacity: 1; transform: none;"><div class="_52d39cfefd3c69f6924b373a833705ed" data-style-context="dark"><div class="deb1fa11d14958ceb2de143c0e1dd0cf _8702b2bb1aa14dfd61475654a9f56071"><div class="_945ec308dc1c653fb4919cb4edfca994" style="opacity:1"><a class="_6930d9e9433190165ee5fb0cc67909b4" data-x="link-to-article" href="/en/article/working-with-a-disability/" target="_self"><span class="a1edbe1701f29ccf5681f3198aee0b10">Working with a disability: “Go on that adventure together”</span></a></div><div class="_880ea949a6d3fb3d59a0527dd31361d9"><img alt="Man sits on the couch and looks into the camera" class="" height="4724" sizes="281.25px" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=3543&amp;h=4724&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=897,0,1750,2362&amp;w=20&amp;h=27&amp;blur=20&amp;q=0&amp;auto=format 1w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=887,0,1770,2362&amp;w=320&amp;h=427&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 320w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=480&amp;h=640&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 480w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=720&amp;h=960&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 720w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=1024&amp;h=1365&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1024w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=1440&amp;h=1920&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1440w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=1920&amp;h=2560&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 1920w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=2400&amp;h=3200&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 2400w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=3000&amp;h=4000&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 3000w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/dwhem0hv/prd/d029f113460edfd098f87c770507c4845f8aa7f6-3543x2362.jpg?rect=886,0,1772,2362&amp;w=3543&amp;h=4724&amp;q=80&amp;auto=format 3543w" style="object-fit: cover;" width="3543"/></div><div class="_5b17a06c66cac7963d12b875e99ad958"><div class="ba931bd49a48d7ec89f9072d22b4656a" style="opacity:1">Article</div><div class="_774ada7a514ff51436128eb00267b57a"><span role="presentation"><svg fill="none" height="16" viewbox="0 0 16 16" width="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
