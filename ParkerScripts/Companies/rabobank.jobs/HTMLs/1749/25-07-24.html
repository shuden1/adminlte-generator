After more than 30 years at Rabobank, people know where to find her. We spoke to Judith about her mission and personal conviction that 'working together will get you further'. Her desire for innovation and about her journey: from a desk job to being Director of the Cooperative Rabobank District Zuid-Holland. \"Dare to do what you want to do.\"","content":"\"I always look for the place I can learn the most,\" Judith says enthusiastically. She has been Director of the Cooperative Rabobank District Zuid-Holland since April 2021. When this position crossed her path, she seized the opportunity with both hands. \"I always want to innovate. That is how I ended up here. I believe in continuous improvement. That is part of my mission: to make the world a bit better. Together, with colleagues, with members, with customers and with entrepreneurs in the region. As far as I'm concerned, that goes hand-in-hand.\"\n\nIn the beginnings\n\n\"My very first job at Rabobank was behind the counter in Werkendam. I came straight from secondary school and really started there. In those days, you arranged everything at the counter. For example, people came with their piggy banks to deposit money. I met many customers there; I learned something new every day. Why did I choose to work at Rabobank? I had always found economics interesting and I saw many opportunities in such a large organisation. I thought: I can build my career here. Judith laughs - in the meantime, she has moved on to more than fourteen positions: \"Yes, I have lived through the entire organisation! I like the different sides of the company.\"\n\nTo work for the same organisation for so long, the attraction must be strong. \" In the past, it seemed really dull to me: celebrating working somewhere for 25 years. But thanks to the many opportunities you get here, I have never found working for Rabobank boring. During my work and in the evenings, I always kept on learning and studying. Rabobank supported that. I also really like the bank's cooperative mission. I really enjoy working together and achieving things with others.\"\n\nThe way forward is together\n\n\"In my current position for example, I am responsible for the subject energy transition in my region. This is exactly the kind of subject that cannot be tackled in isolation. For instance, we help entrepreneurs put solar panels on their roofs. That is beneficial for the entrepreneurs and contributes to the energy transition in general. You have to bring people together to get real results. Listen to each other. I think that's the way forward. Certainly for a complex topic like energy transition, that is essential.\"\n\nJudith draws inspiration from Father van den Elsen, one of the founders of the boerenleenbank, the predecessor of the Rabobank. He said: 'A loner is a drowner'. \"I believe in the power of strengthening each other. I always try to connect people. Colleagues, clients, networks. For me, that is an attitude: being actively open to the ideas and wisdom of others. I often ask for advice. Two heads are better than one. And the best part is: this way you always meet new people and discover new things.\"\n\nDare to do what you want\n\nAfter several years at the bank, Judith made a radical choice. While she had the chance to become Director Private Clients, she chose to switch to Rabobank International. \"I was going to do a traineeship in a totally different part of the bank. Nothing was the same, except for the Rabobank logo on the letterhead. That was an exciting decision.\"\n\n\"By making this switch, I deliberately missed out on the opportunity to become Director for private clients. People thought I was crazy. Then I knew: this is the right choice. I like to do things differently. At the time, the traineeship suited my passion, qualities and ambition. I wanted to become Director for corporate clients. At the time, there were almost no women in that position, so it seemed like a good objective. And it worked! That was some time ago, but I still see such opportunities for development in this organisation. But you must seize these opportunities yourself. You have to want to improve and renew yourself all the time!\"","createdAt":1700840734,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"1f9afefa8da1","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"The way forward is together with colleagues, clients and entrepreneurs","image":{"_key":"31733381e0cc","_type":"image","alt":"Judith Cok - profiel","asset":{"_ref":"image-f992ee569872328cf445f38a539af5c4a0fc8e46-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["leadership","personal-development"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"traineeship","id":"104c5c67-6cb7-476b-a9a6-f1008f9136e5","title":"Finance","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"finance"},"intro":"Are you a recent graduate with a passion for finance and a desire to make a difference?

To redevelop the model for the international wholesale portfolio as a credit risk modeller is as complex as it is valuable. Senior Credit Risk Modeller Martin van Buren prefers to bite down on the most complicated quantitative issues and likes to talk about it.","content":"Risk analysis: a responsible task\n\n‘Risk is inherent in banking, because any loan has a chance of not being fully paid back. From mortgages to large corporate loans, for every loan portfolio in the bank there is a credit model that helps us manage the risks . Our team is working on the redevelopment of the PD-model of the international wholesale portfolio. To this end, we perform quantitative analyses on immense amounts of data to map out the creditworthiness of customers.’\n\n‘Our credit models are the basis for decision-making. That is quite a responsibility, especially when it comes to the international wholesale portfolio. Our clients range from Dutch SMEs to the listed corporates we all recognize from the economics section of the newspaper. In terms of credit risk capital, this is Rabobank’s largest portfolio.’\n\n‘So in terms of exposure, it’s billions – but the social impact is also huge. Many companies depend on our model. As one of the largest financial institutions in the Netherlands, Rabobank bears joint responsibility for a healthy financial climate. That pressure is palpable, both from the business and the ECB, but it is definitely motivating. We know very well what we are contributing to.’\n\nThe redevelopment of redevelopments\n\n‘Modelling is always a cyclical process, but the cycle we are now in is of unprecedented proportions. I have been working for Rabobank since 2007 and have never done a project as extensive as the redevelopment of this model. The data landscape is vast, the diversity of clients is enormous, the standards we have to meet are sky-high, regulations are – rightly – increasingly stringent and we have to deal with many different stakeholders and interests.’\n\n‘A model is a simplified representation of reality. But that reality is a rather complex whole that is constantly changing, so that is our greatest challenge. “Keep it simple, stupid”, is what I always say. And if we can find the right balance between that transparent simplicity and that complex reality, we really make a difference. For a credit risk modeller, this is the moment where you can write history: this redevelopment of the model. There is a lot at stake.’\n\nThe human side of a technical profession\n\n‘In my team, that pressure creates an extra drive to perfect the model. I manage a team of 10 modellers. They program, mainly in Python, to perform the analyses to identify and quantify risks. I am the bridge between them, the management and other stakeholders. Such as the business, i.e. the people who use the models, but also IT for the implementation, the data team for the quality of the data, the validation team and audit. The latter two monitor the model content and process.’\n\n‘Personally, I find the network of stakeholders a very nice aspect of this profession. Risk analytics sounds quite technical, and in the core it is, but it is also very human. The complexity lies, on the one hand, in the quantitative puzzle itself and, on the other hand, in the interpretations and the various interests it represents. In the end, we all serve the client. And yes, we use advanced Python scripts, but we must always be able to explain it to everyone, including non-technical stakeholders. Whether it is senior management, the business or the regulator, the model must be as transparent and understandable as possible.’\n\nTogether for the best result\n\n‘I am incredibly proud of my team. The pressure is high, the dynamics matchless and the atmosphere is good! We are a very close team of very smart people from all over the world and we work very closely together. So, many stand-ups, round-table discussions and knowledge sharing meetings. We are critical and keep each other on our toes. Normally, we do a lot of fun things besides work. Covid has made that a little less, but we still have a lot of fun together.’\n\n‘That atmosphere contributes to everyone’s dedication to making this project a success. We did not miss a deadline, I am really proud of that. Everyone helps each other, within the team but also outside. This mentality is typical of Rabobank: we always make time for others, no matter how busy we are. There is a great awareness that you get the best results together, especially within risk analytics. From this profession, you are the most intertwined with all parts of the bank – and you feel that.’","createdAt":1701870794,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"7874efecc99a","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Making history as a credit risk modeller; it is happening now","image":{"_key":"bdcabe98c66d","_type":"image","alt":"Martin van Buren at the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-ccc8cc70ce78523775fcc33ba3f3fea67517c41f-2560x1267-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["analytics-consulting","business-acumen","cloud-computing","coding-languages","craftsmanship","data-visualization","disciplined-execution","predictive-modeling","professional-collaboration","responsible-ai","stakeholder-management"],"proofPoints":["social-innovation","work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"data-modeling","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"page","id":"2c48f045-cdb3-45cf-ac30-484478ade51e","title":"Start you career at the FEC campus","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fec-campus"},"intro":"At Rabobank, the number of analysts working in the field of Financial Economic Crime is growing considerably.

Beautiful words, but how do you deal in actuality with someone who reacts differently? Who asks questions that other people might not dare to ask. We talk about it with Asuerus van Tuijl, who has autism, and his manager Robert van Putten. ‘We can find a place for everybody'.","content":"Asuerus is a Service Analyst at Rabobank in the Customer & Service Monitoring department: \"I call myself a jack of all trades. For example, I arrange authorizations within the department, for both colleagues and customers. I also manage the website, make reports for vulnerabilities and do other odd jobs. I don't like routine and in this role I have a lot of variety. I work with people, computers and technology and I work on the organization and the culture. It's very challenging.\"\n\nRobert: \"Asuerus has an open role. He works in with several different teams and other departments also know how to find him. This position is also really focused on Asuerus. When I started in this department, I was looking for someone who could help us with authorization-related issues. Someone who enjoys figuring out things like that. I immediately thought of Asuerus, because I already knew him from a previous department.\"\n\nLooking at capabilities\n\nAsuerus: \"I was out of work for a while and then I volunteered at ITvitae, an organization that helps IT people with high-functioning autism or highly gifted people to find work. Through ITvitae, I ended up at Rabobank. I have experienced the application as really positive. They know that you have come from ITvitae and therefore have a challenge, but they didn't look at that when I applied. Just whether you fit in with the department.\"\n\nRobert: \"ITvitae supports us with clear instructions, when they bring in a new employee. These are unique for each person. What things to discuss, what agreements to make, what to do in what situation. That has helped me a lot.\"\n\nListening to each other\n\nAsuerus doesn't need any specific adjustments: \"It's mainly the match between me and the department and the person in charge of the department. They need to know what to expect from me and how to address me and vice versa. And that's all the adjustment I need.\"\n\nRobert: \"I didn't take any training or course to understand this further, but I'm just in constant conversation with Asuerus: what's going on, what do you need, how can I help you do your job in an enjoyable way. It actually comes naturally to me, it's not a specific management style.\"\n\nAsuerus adds: \"Yes, actually it is. It's just not something you can learn. It's more the person you are. Being open to the other person, being a good listener and trust are most important.\"\n\nInclusion at Rabobank\n\nAsuerus: \"I see that Rabobank pays a lot of attention to diversity and inclusion. On the policy side, a lot is happening to create an inclusive corporate culture where people make use of each other's talents. In practice, however, this is not always easy. It is also often difficult - or more difficult than Rabobank would like - to give people who are a little different a place. That is because of the difference between people with and without autism. My disability only started to 'bother' me when I began to work.\"\n\n\"My expectations were way too high. Everything was different than I had imagined: people interacted very differently and communication was not always smooth. My biggest problem was with people who found my being different inconvenient. I just don't want to be bothered by people too much. I am practicing to let my voice be heard in situations I find difficult. Because if I don't mention things, then no one else will learn from it either.\"\n\nRobert agrees: \"You used to avoid situations like that. You have to find the right route. For example, we have a set time every month when we talk to each other. But if there are some things going on, we speak to each other every week. In fifteen minutes Asuerus brings me up to speed, we give each other feedback and I can make adjustments if necessary.\"\n\nWorking on a place for everyone\n\nAsuerus: \"As far as I'm concerned, the practical application of the inclusion policy should focus on communication and work etiquette. Fortunately, the bank is very open to our ideas. I am a member of the RAP aan de Slag, our employee network for colleagues with occupational disabilities. The bank regularly asks us how we see things and in what way they can help us further.\"\n\n\"We think there is a place for everyone within the bank. One of the things we're doing is developing training for colleagues on what neurodiversity is and how to deal with it. We're looking for ways to tell our story. I actually see us as the canary in the coal mine: we identify sensitivities in the organization. And help think about improvements.

Although entrepreneurs are often so involved in their own business that they sometimes only admit to themselves at the very last moment that other measures are needed. That is also our first step: helping them gain insight. Then the solutions are devised and together we look at how time can be bridged financially\".\n\nDirect effects of the coronacrisis\n\n\"The coronacrisis of course had an impact on clients who were already assisted by Bijzonder Beheer before the crisis. One of these customers is an international transport company that saw up to 75% of its turnover disappear within a week due to lockdowns in the countries around us. The entrepreneur himself shifted quickly and came up with a well-substantiated problem analysis. Within a few days, we were able to arrange a postponement of his repayments and solve his liquidity problem. Thanks to our colleague who knew the sector and the customer's situation well and was able to switch very quickly\".\n\n\"At the other end of the spectrum, we had a medical device customer in demand for a major funding expansion. Something we don't see very often in Special Asset Management, of course. But here, too, the right expertise was quickly called in and, together with a deal team, financing was set up within a week. This enabled the company to continue to supply its products to national and international hospitals\".\n\nMaking choices\n\n\"In times of crisis, my staff's hearts start beating faster, so to speak, because that' s when they can really add value. Fortunately, that results in success stories, but of course we also experience distressing cases. Where the message for the entrepreneur does not contain good news. This emotional side should not be underestimated; in many cases you literally talk about the life's work of an entrepreneur, which sometimes makes the conversations very intense. An empathic and analytical ability is therefore necessary in this job, because you have a great responsibility. You have to be able to deal with this. Because of the speed with which decisions have to be made, we often have a limited set of information at our disposal, so you have to be able and daring to make choices. This makes the job exciting and fun\".\n\nA healthy business\n\n\"Special Asset Management is distributed all over the country. It's a club of a few hundred people. We work closely together with the account managers, because it is the intention that we are only temporarily involved with these clients. The goal is to get the customer back to account management in good health as soon as possible. So there is mutual contact about the status of and agreements with the client\".\n\n\"As an employee of Special Asset Management, you generally have your own portfolio. The work itself may be somewhat solitary, which is why we organise events in order to learn from each other. From the case-studies, the different clients and how to deal with them. We also share successes on a weekly basis: clients who are financially back on the road and no longer need our guidance. We also look at what others can learn from this.\"\n\nProfit as a tool\n\n\"Working for a cooperative where profit is not a goal in itself gives me extra motivation. Profit is a means to help more customers achieve their ambitions. We don't work for shareholder value. So we can use it to make a substantial contribution to the welfare and prosperity of the Netherlands and to feeding the world in a sustainable way\".\n\n\"Our main goal at Special Asset Management is to offer a new perspective to the customer. So they can focus on their future again. With a restored business, or due to business closure with a different interpretation. Because also by breaking up in a good way, you offer perspective again. The fact that we are allowed to do our part makes me feel good\".","createdAt":1700836447,"updatedAt":1702978833,"representation":{"_key":"977cdc13ed82","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Holding up a mirror to the entrepreneur","image":{"_key":"ace9c8bcf086","_type":"image","alt":"Sander van Norren - buiten","asset":{"_ref":"image-c0995c1cdff8f8db7c8431e029a33aab55b007d2-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"corporate-banking","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"afd1c03e-3139-4262-bf94-0cfa0c9dc1dd","title":"Legal work where you have to be able to empathize with the client","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"legal-work-where-you-have-to-be-able-to-empathize-with-the-client"},"intro":"\"Sometimes the situation for an entrepreneur has deteriorated so much due to internal or external factors that his business is no longer viable.

She started out as account manager Afbouw & Insolventie for the department of Special Asset Management and has since been promoted to team leader. She talks about her work and what it takes to do the work in the best possible way.\n\n\"The process of the final closure of his business requires empathy for the entrepreneur. The customer is actually in the process of mourning, when he sees his life's work go under. Entrepreneurs go through different phases of acceptance and you have to be able to deal with that and respond to them emphatically. Afterwards, we regularly hear that they are relieved and happy with the guidance they have received.\"\n\nBanking and customer interests can sometimes clash\n\n\"Because banking and customer interests can clash, we always advise the customer to take on his own advisor. Even though we are looking for the best possible solution for both parties, everyone defends their own interests.We consider an honest and unambiguous relationship with customers to be an important starting point and we receive positive feedback on this approach.\"\n\n“The customer's future after the insolvency is very important to us. For example, we always try to prevent the most serious consequences for their personal situation. After all, these are issues that have the greatest impact on the daily life of the entrepreneur. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work out, but I really believe that Rabobank's policy on remaining debt is the right one.\"\n\nBeing of added value in a difficult situation\n\n\"This work is a good combination of working on legal issues as well as being in contact with the client. It is precisely in such a difficult situation that the bank can offer added value by coming up with a workable solution together. The way Rabobank deals with the customer in this situations suits me very well.\"\n\n\"Financial and legal knowledge form the basis; knowing what works and what doesn’t work. You talk to clients, but also, for example, to liquidators. You have to be well versed in order to be able to communicate effectively with various parties and make the appropriate arrangements. And since you're working on several files in different phases of insolvency, it's also useful to be able to maintain an overview.\"\n\nStronger together\n\n\"We share our experiences internally with other departments, such as Account management and Special Asset Management. We see what has gone wrong at businesses and provide feedback. So that we, as an organisation and our customers, can learn how mistakes can be prevented in the future.\"\n\n\"We are driven to achieve the best possible result for the customer and those are pretty tough conversations. Contact with colleagues is therefore very important in order to be able to let things go, to discuss things before or after and to vent your heart.\"","createdAt":1701683521,"updatedAt":1703005110,"representation":{"_key":"351d87bf3955","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Nienke den Ouden","asset":{"_ref":"image-d1aea731815aa3f180f715cddbb202d802d361e5-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"title":"Legal work and empathize with the client","label":"article"},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","coaching","customer-focused","data-insights","disciplined-execution","emotional-intelligence","performance-management-pm","professional-collaboration","self-reflection"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"corporate-banking","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"page","id":"fa9b5f97-6b86-4e77-a05c-d630e9b365fa","title":"Develop your skills ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"develop-your-skills"},"intro":"Even though computers and robots are performing more and more tasks, it doesn’t mean our jobs are going to disappear.

Hundreds of cyber employees are joining forces to stay as far ahead of cybercriminals as possible. Systems are getting better and better and IT specialists are getting smarter, but does the same apply to the other side. Cybersecurity is no longer a future topic. Now it's the time.","content":"More about The Red Team\n\nOne of the teams working on cybersecurity is the odd one out. Rabobank's Red Team is a team of ethical hackers that tries to attack the bank in all sorts of ways, with the goal of actually protecting it. From actively hacking its own systems, to an \"innocent\" phishing email to Rabobank colleagues; the Red Team tries to discover weaknesses in security, so they can then strengthen them.\n\nWho are these people? How do they operate, and where lies the ethical boundary? You will hear from ethical hackers Luc Kolen, Neal de Vocht and their team lead Kelvin Rorive himself in this three-part podcast (Dutch only).\n\nWhat's going on?\n\nWidespread digitization\nThe Netherlands is one of the most digitized countries, thanks to education, entrepreneurs and government. Ever larger parts of society are moving into the digital domain. And the more digital the society, the more likely cybercrime will occur.\n\nCybercriminals are getting smarter\nCybercriminals possess specialized knowledge. They are getting smarter and smarter, trying to hack systems and organizations through phishing, ransomware and DDoS attacks. The chance of an organization being hit by a cyber attack is currently 1 in 5.\n\nThe impact is significant\nDoes a hacker manage to get in? Then that could mean private data is out in the open, systems are locked down and people can't do their jobs.\n\nThe Red Team as the ultimate test\n\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, a bank has a duty of care to make customers and business owners aware of the risks and to make sure they can bank safely. In doing so, you can never rule out a cyber attack completely, but you can reduce the chance as much as possible. But you don't know if something is really secure until you attack it. That's what makes the work of the Red Team so important. They are the ultimate cybersecurity test.","createdAt":1701261331,"updatedAt":1703058309,"representation":{"_key":"630a190eccfe","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"The Red Team: the ethical hackers of Rabobank","image":{"_key":"77ff1f2daddd","_type":"image","alt":"Luc en Neal sitting on the stairs in the office","asset":{"_ref":"image-abb0b3635465a888762d74b8a78a72d4ad8ad2bf-2200x1404-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["change-agility","cloud-computing","customer-focused","digital-literacy","disciplined-execution","distributed-systems","information-technology-security","information-technology-strategies","problem-management","solution-architecture","technology-landscape"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges"],"vakgebied":"it","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"type":"article","id":"10a76fb4-b6da-4a34-8e97-05481af3423d","title":"Lisanne, Product Owner within FEC tech: \"If all goes well, the customer doesn’t know anything about what we do\"","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"lisanne-product-owner-within-fec-tech"},"intro":"Transferring money, completing payments, and online banking. How do you make it easy for customers and difficult for fraudsters? That question is central to the work of the enthusiastic Lisanne, a Product Owner within the Tech department of FEC (Financial Economic Crime). “What makes me really happy? When the team has built something new with which we outsmart fraudsters!”","content":"Fraud detection: hot topic\n\nLisanne’s work is a hot topic: fraud appears in the news, the newspapers, and even at birthdays. It is the topic of conversation. Lisanne: “Someone told me he was scammed via Marktplaats,” At the same birthday, someone wanted to order pizzas for 10 people and was irritated because he needed to use his Rabo Scanner. “I understand, but I look at such a situation from a different perspective: we build something like that to protect you as a customer.”\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking an Impact\n\nThe team doesn’t have direct customer contact, but they do make a direct impact on the customer. “If all goes well, the customer won’t notice what we’re doing.” Behind the scenes, the team processes fraud reports, and improves and renews the model to counter new fraud methods. “During a stand-up, it’s great to hear that the team has built something new that has stopped multiple fraud attempts.”\n\n\nFrom Analyst to Product Owner FEC Tech\n\nWith her academic background in marketing and data analytics, Lisanne began her career at Rabobank as a Business Analyst. “I fulfilled a very technical role and noticed after a while that I wanted to broaden my horizons. Despite my built-up IT experience at Rabobank, I prefer to deal with people; stakeholder management and such.”\n\nLisanne received a call from a colleague who wanted to introduce her to the role of Product Owner. She followed several trainings (including Professional Scrum Product Owner) and after a number of internal conversations, she was allowed to make the move. “I combined my role as Business Analyst with the role of Product Owner for half a year. After that half year, I was sure: I am making the move to Product Owner at FEC Tech.”\n\nSocial Value\n\nBeing a Product Owner suits Lisanne well. She enthusiastically talks about various highlights of the past year. One of them was an interesting implementation in the Rabo App. “That had to do with sending push messages, with which customers are informed when things happen around their account. It was a project with social value, that ran through the entire chain. It was fantastic that so many teams were involved.” And what does the future bring? “We are looking forward to transitioning to a new, complex system. One where the route to it is partly unknown. It’s up to me to keep the team satisfied and involved in the developments.” It is a challenging task with a complex transition, but the team must continue to develop. “Fraudsters are getting smarter, so we always have to stay one step ahead.”\n\n\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1711456027,"updatedAt":1714124315,"representation":{"_key":"7a39156cc5f9","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"image":{"_type":"image","alt":"Lisanne","asset":{"_ref":"image-6b50520f37765c231bc80d4f6bd1368518fe16ae-6585x4390-jpg","_type":"reference"},"crop":{"_type":"sanity.imageCrop","bottom":0,"left":0,"right":0,"top":0},"hotspot":{"_type":"sanity.imageHotspot","height":1,"width":0.5183042761397685,"x":0.6219678904912241,"y":0.5}},"label":"article","title":"Lisanne, Product Owner within FEC tech: \"If all goes well, the customer doesn’t know anything about what we do\""},"skills":["business-process-improvements","business-strategies","change-agility","consulting","disciplined-execution","professional-collaboration","project-coordination"],"proofPoints":["work-related-challenges","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"cdd","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"Fellenoord 17","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00109695","city":"Eindhoven","consent":["Data Retention - 2024","Voluntary gender-identification"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"nl","display_order":4,"label_de":"Niederlande","label_en":"The Netherlands","label_es":"Países Bajos","label_fr":"Pays-Bas","label_nl":"Nederland","label_pt":"Países Baixos"}],"date_start":1720703578729,"date_updated":1721113852078,"hours_max":"36","job_branch":[{"code":"it","display_order":1,"label_de":"IT","label_en":"IT","label_es":"TI","label_fr":"IT\u002FTechnologies de l’information","label_nl":"IT","label_pt":"TI"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"Do you want to make the difference in our Tribe Housing, we make sure we can deliver and maintain a sustainable mortgage for all our customers.

Acquisition financing is comparable to a mortgage, except it’s for businesses. It was an interesting position that I learned a lot from.

This combination has helped me take massive leaps as a Young Professional. After all, personal development is at least equally important as professional developoment. During the program you get to work on your soft skills with other Young Professionals. Everything from participating in a training about leadership skills to talking about what you find difficult and which personal goals you would like to work on. I learned what my style of communication is and how to use it to work better in a team. I also discovered one of my weaknesses. I can develop tunnel vision a lot faster than other people. Now that I am aware of this characteristic though, it’s easier to watch out for it.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the program like?\n\n“In the beginning there are several days of introduction so we can get to know Rabobank better. One of the things we learn is what is important to the bank. Because Rabobank focuses on food & agri, during the introduction phase we learn what that means in practice for different departments. For example, granting loans can be linked to achieving sustainability targets. That demonstrates that the bank is more than a lending party; it’s also a valuable partner for companies.”\n\n“Another great thing about the program is that you get to know many other Young Professionals. We participate in a variety of training courses together and we share our experiences. In addition, the program offers the option of doing a rotation in a different department.”\n\nDiverse and Dynamic Work\n\n“I currently work in Acquisition Finance as a credit analyst. My work is diverse and challenging. I have my own portfolio of corporate clients who have loans with us. The value of these clients’ finance packages ranges between a few hundred million to billions of euros; the loans are financed by multiple banks and also partly financed by investors. My clients operate in different sectors, like retail, recruitment, and food & agri. I monitor their financial performance, check the risk profiles, and help the investment managers maintain the client relationship. If something is not right, it is my responsibility to promptly flag it within the bank. What that means in practice is that I do all sorts of applications and draw up reports for our department’s management and the risk department.”\n\n“I also work on new transactions, which is all about bringing in new clients. My job is to work with the deal team to secure internal approval for extending the loan. To do that, I research the new corporate client by reading reports about their business and sector, and I make financial projections based on their financial planning. That way we can accurately assess what the risk will be for the bank. This part of my job has taught me so much about stakeholder mangement because I get to work with so many different internal and external parties. That includes the Know Your Customer department (which is concerned with flagging fraud and money laundering) and the Legal department. I’m also in touch with outside parties like other banks, advisers, and lawyers. In short: this is such a dynamic environment.”\n\n\n\nWhat is the supervision like?\n\n“I have monthly meetings with the young talent manager who supervises me. We talk about how things are going at work, during trainings, and how my development is coming along in terms of my personal goals. The diverse group of Young Professionals also provides a valuable form of supervision. With so many different backgrounds, ambitions, and kinds of knowledge in one group, it enriches your existing network and expands it instantly. I wouldn’t want to miss out on this program for all the money in the world. I definitely see my development progressing, but I’m not yet sure what position I’d like to end up in. Thanks to the program, I have the opportunity to develop a good foundation as a banker while I also have access to the tools I need for further growth. That way, I can make better choices when it comes to my career.”\n\n\n\n","createdAt":1701706104,"updatedAt":1716553302,"representation":{"_key":"27ebec8d0daa","_type":"tileImage","fieldsCannotBeEmpty":true,"label":"article","title":"Would you like to become a versatile banker through the Young Professional Program in Corporate Banking?","image":{"_key":"e4ddd71f9b8a","_type":"image","alt":"Young women is sitting behind laptop and looking into the camera","asset":{"_ref":"image-e842dc3ab8077b53ea2d1e4cbe9f1662b879e951-1280x720-jpg","_type":"reference"}}},"skills":["active-listening","business-analysis","business-strategies","credit-analysis","customer-analytics","data-insights","disciplined-execution","market-research","professional-collaboration","regulatory-compliance-management"],"proofPoints":["personal-development","work-culture"],"vakgebied":"corporate-banking","language":"en","_type":"article"},{"address":"Croeselaan 18","backoffice":"workday","backoffice_id":"JR_00107039","city":"Utrecht","consent":["Data Retention - 2024","Voluntary gender-identification"],"contract_type":[{"code":"fulltime","display_order":1,"label_de":"Vollzeit","label_en":"Full time","label_es":"A tiempo completo","label_fr":"Temps complet","label_nl":"Fulltime","label_pt":"Tempo integral"}],"country":[{"code":"nl","display_order":4,"label_de":"Niederlande","label_en":"The Netherlands","label_es":"Países Bajos","label_fr":"Pays-Bas","label_nl":"Nederland","label_pt":"Países Baixos"}],"date_start":1720424952024,"date_updated":1720424935164,"hours_max":"36","job_branch":[{"code":"it","display_order":1,"label_de":"IT","label_en":"IT","label_es":"TI","label_fr":"IT\u002FTechnologies de l’information","label_nl":"IT","label_pt":"TI"}],"job_description":[{"_type":"block","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"You will get the opportunity to work in beating heart of data within the Rabobank.
