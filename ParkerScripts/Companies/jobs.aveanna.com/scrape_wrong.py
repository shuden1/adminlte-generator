Since I am unable to directly view or analyze the content of the HTML file you've uploaded within this environment, creating a specific script tailored to scrape job listings from it with accurate selectors is not possible without knowing the exact HTML structure and selectors present in the file.

Therefore, I am unable to generate a "correct" script based on the provided HTML file's structure or create one that accurately reflects the step 1 requirements without seeing the file's content.

I recommend examining the HTML file to identify the correct CSS selectors for job titles and their associated URLs, following the guidelines provided in step 1, before updating the script accordingly.
