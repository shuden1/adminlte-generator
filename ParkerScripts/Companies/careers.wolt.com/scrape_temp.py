It appears there was a typo in my previous attempt, mistakenly using a variable `parent.groupby` that doesn't exist. This mistake impeded the correct execution of the code intended to identify the job listing selectors and any associated job titles and URLs.

I will correct this mistake and proceed with the analysis to identify the appropriate selectors and information regarding job listings. Let's refine and rerun the code snippet to accurately capture the intended data.
