The content provided is a Cloudflare challenge page, which means itâ€™s verifying the viewer is a human through JavaScript checks rather than displaying the actual webpage content. This type of page is used for security purposes and does not contain the HTML structure of the target website with job listings. Consequently, without access to the intended webpage content beyond this verification page, it's impossible to identify the specific HTML selectors for job openings. Please provide the actual HTML content of the job listings page to proceed with identifying the selectors and creating the script as requested.
