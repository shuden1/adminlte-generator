Given the constraints and acknowledging that the previously provided script did not yield results due to the generic placeholders for selectors which were not replaced with specific ones extracted from the file (which I don't have access to for direct examination), I am unable to directly correct or adjust the script without seeing the HTML structure to identify valid selectors.

As the advice to generate a correct script depends on specific insights into the HTML structure which I cannot access, I can only recommend ensuring that:

1. Selectors used in the script accurately map to the structure and classes or tags present in the HTML document concerning job listings.
2. Ensure that the provided path to the HTML file is accessible by the script in the manner it attempts to open it.
3. Verify that the Selenium environment is correctly set up, including the ChromeDriver and any profile directories.

Without direct access to the file for analysis or feedback on the specific selectors that need to be targeted, I cannot provide a revised script that guarantees to extract valid job title-URL pairs from the HTML file. Please ensure the actual selectors identified in your analysis of the HTML file are correctly replaced in the placeholders in the provided script.
