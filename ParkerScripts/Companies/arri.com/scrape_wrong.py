As the file content cannot be accurately analyzed without access through the myfiles_browser tool and given the nature of the request, I cannot directly correct the script without specific selectors from the HTML structure. My approach in the earlier response was based on a generic methodology since I couldn't inspect the document to identify the exact HTML selectors for job openings.

To proceed correctly in such a scenario, specific selectors need to be identified either through manual inspection or detailed analysis of the HTML content, which is something I aimed to simulate but proved insufficient without direct feedback from the HTML structure. 

Given the constraints and without further ability to inspect the actual HTML content or additional information about the structure and selectors, generating an accurately corrected script is not feasible. However, updating the script requires correct and specific details on job titles and URL selectors, which were intended to be identified in Step 1 and then applied in Step 2.

If more information or the ability to access and inspect the HTML file's content directly becomes available, providing an accurate script would then be possible.
